# Just to write down some thoughts

By now the ideas I meant to write about are all too mashed up in my head, partly trying to combine and link them, mostly just trying to digest.

Maybe I feel like writing now is appropiate because of the recent elections in Belgium, showing huge rifts in a population I thought I wanted to be part of (I am not a Belgian citizen, but could relatively easily become one, if I wanted to, which I was seriously considering until the results of the elections of the 25th May), or maybe it is appropriate because I am nearing the end of my school year (and procrastination is a must) and the completion of my degree, and have been waiting for this break away for a while.

This should talk about graphic design and what I thought it was, what I found out it could be, what it can mean, and why I want to pursue the convictions that those points have brought on.

We, as a team, have more or less finished off our first big design job in our own names. A website, and a pretty important (scale wise) one for a first job. For a school, none the less, a fellow artistic school from Brussels. The experience was great, and there were many lessons learnt but that should be for an other blog post. The clients ended up asking me what I was up to next 

I meant for this article to have a more philosophical lean to it... Open source and politics, politics and open source.

Bernard Stiegler. Economie de la contribution.
Stiegler outlines an origin to the economy of contribution through a rapid history of consumerism, preceeded by an industrial capitalist movement. Capitalism had been around longer than industry, but his talking points start at industrial capitalism, a capitalism of investments, where crossing technical abilities and science enable great efficiency and massive production. Nothing new here. The direct cost of this is a dismantling of the everydays person's life through the ridiculisation his abilities, reducing him down into proletariat.
20th century dawns and we see the arrival of consumerist capitalism. Initially associated with Fordism, we note that with this now noted trend, not only have the working class lost all their ability to do but one thing, but also that the consumer loses all ability to live life decently, who lose their savoir vivre.

So then why a contributive economy. Stiegler looks at the Open Source movement to answer this.
He looks at the contributive economy as a model that strives for de-proletarisation. Up to now, industrial expansion lead to proletarisation, and generalised proletarisation, where one loses the ability to even fathom the scope of the field in which he is acting. A reduction to such a bare minimum of function, that the individual can not understand the consequences of his actions. The system has entirely gone above him.
Stiegler points out that this is happening inside higher level education, where industries have moved far enough as to forget (forget to teach) it's origins. Again, an area of a spectrum, leaving the student with the only ability to do, without thinking, with skills but no knowledge. Extrapolating this example leads to Fukushima. Rethinking if it would not be worth to rather rebuild a knowledge than a simple set of skills. Always production orientated. 
Generalised proletariat is this learning to work today within ready made systems that do not reveal their histories, their origins, ignoring their makings in the interest of productivity. Ultimately we're loosing our knowledge, by externalising the knowledge by the system we've actually forgotten them.

Stiegler then concentrated on people within the OS community, which he points out are part of an industrial world, a area of working that could not be without industrialism,  but and industrialism that does not rely on proletarisation of it's actors. This is very important because in reintroduces the notion of individuation. The ability that I have, on my own, to change myself, to constantly question myself, to become who I am. (Nietszche - Peindard) But that requires knowledge. It is knowledge that enables one to individuate himself. All kinds of knowledge, big and small, contribute to this. 
It is when one has knowledge that he individuated himself. Individuation in a group inevitably educes individuation. He calls it co-individuation. I myself, by questioning myself and collecting knowledge of all types, automatically bring you on to individuate yourself. This constitutes a type of a constitutive model.

Stiegler and his group think that this constitutive model can and must generalize itself. Firstly because one of the results of the various forms of capitalism we've known now mean that people do not care, in industries, about their jobs. People only work through sanctions. This means that there is no interest in learning, no desire to better oneself, to continue learning, just the sanctions to keep the worker coming. Max Weber seems to have explained that if capitalism has grown, it was because it created motivation. We know this to no longer be true. There is no more motivation inside capitalism. Or if their is motivation, it comes in the form of addiction, either on the very high levels of people getting rushes out of manipulating extreme amounts of money, or on the low level of simply being addicted to money. The motivations may be apparently hidden behind various types of justifications, but there is no motivation in capitalism. 

Producers, in the capitalist model, have become proletarians. Hackers, are the first producers of the capitalist age who have founded their working on de-proletarisation, but is is also true for the consumer. Because open source has at it's roots the need to bridge between producer and consumer.

The 19th century was based on the opposition of capital versus work, the 20th century still has that oppostion, but add to it the opposing producer and consumer.

The contribution system does not work like this, and Stiegler mentionned how this economy must somehow, become generalised, as the need to reinstore motivation on both the producer and consumer end comes back to us through digital abilities. It works only through the participation of all. Participation and contribution are not the same, but by participating, one contributes, 

You can participat without being a contributer but the contributer is a participant, and by participating he is not only contributing, he is taking part in a contributive economy. A contributive economy is an economy inside which each participant individuates himself by participating.

The common point in these economies are that the participant is curious. Curious in the old french way of the term: the opposite of incurieux, with it's roots in the word incurie, meaning jemenfoutisme. Or irresponsabilit√©, and again, lack of motivation. Incurie of the society, now obvious to all. Individuality is king. (cfr. recent elections).

This is a result of a system that is turning us into cretins.
Ars Industrialis look at contributive economies in a theraputical way. A way to consider digital as a commons, that must be taken care of. The internet would be nothing without it's economy of contributions. But these economies must indeed be nurtured in way that we are conscious of all the form digital can take. Digital matter is our new writing, or at least it has as much impact if not more. It could be used as surveillence systems or it could be used to build a huge online encyclopedia, sharing and bettering itself by gathering individual knowledge into the commons.
