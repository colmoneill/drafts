#### John Jonston introduction to F. Kittler: Media theory After Poststructuralism
---
##### introduction

In *Grammophone, Film, Typewriter* Kittler puts forwards the example of the jet airliner as a meeting point for many media types, ranging from radar to microwaved meals, *the passengers are encased in a "multimedia embryonic sack"*. (Johnston on Kittler, 1997, p.3) The choice of this example item, while still relevant today, is indicative of the time at which the text was written. One could wonder if Kittler would have chosen a different example, had he written within today's media landscape. As the argument constructs, one of the main points put forwards is one called the *dependent variable* —the end result of our senses perceptions being blinded by the non differentiation of media types, in the scheme of computer technologies— where the media situation and environment would end up being a collection of scenarios resulting from the collaboration between engineers and sales people. Technical and modernist knowledge holders on one end, finance driven careerists on the other, together on the mission of distribution. Kittler's deptiction is some 30 years old now, it is safe to say that today's media environment is quite different to the formers. Is this example still the most illustrative of the industry working today?

##### body

Before any question is addressed, we must define what is meant by media landscape, in order to analyse it properly. A landscape is a wide angle, a far reaching view, with items in the tangible foreground, other much away from us. We might not see all of it, we might not even recognise a lot of it, but the use of the idea of a landscape to peer at media as an entity is helpful. Meanwhile let's just remind ourselves that this keyword is the plural of the term *medium*, and *spans a relative diversity* (Ryan, 2012, p.1)  


* Today's media enviroment is not different, but it has advanced.
* The relation of depencency has increased.
* The variaty of examples has grown, but media types have not changed very much.
* An up to date example that also includes laziness, distraction and service providers.
* We've come up with terms that could have helped be more specific, but lines are only more blurred now.

##### conclusions

Nothing really seemes to have changed, but there may be a set new components in the depencency variable which could end up being destructive.
