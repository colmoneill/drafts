## Typoganchi typography biennial

2014

![](typojanchi.JPG)

Photograph from Typojanchi Seoul 2013 biennial workshop: during the typography biennial in Korea, we gave a 5 day workshop during which we re-trained tesseract, an optical character recognition tool, to work on selected examples of Hangul script. We focused on tesseract to compare novice human understanding of Hangul to machinic understanding of the script. This workshop's focus was type design, our challenge was to find a way in which to speak of the subject matter without being familiar with the script or the participants being necessarily familiar with Latin script.

## Drawing Curved

2015

![](drawing-curved.png)

Drawing curved is written research commissioned by the Reader branch of the Libre Graphics Research Unit. Drawing curved looks at the nature of curvature, how curves are calculated and how they are presented. The research touches upon signature machines, lesbian curves, guitar making techniques and wood stripping as a source for natural curvature. The text eventually addresses the graphical representation of curves in software and graphical interfaces.

Authors: Pierre Huyghebaert, Colm O'Neill

Adversarial interfaces is a critical analysis the rhetoric of certain user interfaces. With this analysis and critique the project proposes ways (see menu items) by which to practically and discursively adapt our understandings of computer and network infrastructures in the aim of resisting seamless integration of software and interfaces as totalitised spaces with no alternatives and no outsides.
