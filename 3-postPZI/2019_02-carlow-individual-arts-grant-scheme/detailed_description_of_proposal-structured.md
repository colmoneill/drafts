## Carlow Individual arts grant scheme 2019

> “What I call ecology of practice is a tool for thinking what is happening, and a tool is never neutral. Also, a tool can be passed from hand to hand, but each time the gesture of taking it in hand will be a particular one: the tool is not a general mean, defined as adequate for a set of particular aims, potentially including the one of the person who is taking it, and it does not entail a judgement on the situation as justifying its use.”

### Introduction

The complexity of the tools and technologies that mediate our everyday digital and online life is increasing exponentially. As the technology industry continues its rapid growth, its equally complex for non-technical people to maintain a grasp of how our digital tools function, and what they require to work. I am applying for an individual arts grant to design, prototype and build a physical, performative tool called a pen plotter. A pen plotter helps its audience gain understanding of what digital images are and how they are recorded by computers. This project will help me to address a key question at stake in my practice as a media artist: Can physical, tangible, observable embodiments of technology be used to dismantle the complexity of computers (and their interfaces) enabling better digital literacy ?

#### What is a *Pen plotter* ?

A pen plotter is a type of computer printer that *draws* vector graphics. This type of printer was the norm before the more commonplace ink-jet cartridge printers replaced them. Pen plotters differ from ink-jets as they draw lines (using pens, pencils or the like) rather than spreading ink to fill areas. Pen plotters were used by architects, artists, engineers and scientists alike to *plot* plans, maps, diagrams, shapes, drawings and forms to aid their practices. Multiple computer manufacturing brands built and sold pen plotters in the 70's and 80's but restoring these machines, when available, is very complicated.

### Outline
I am applying for funds to design, prototype and build a large flat bed pen plotter to aid my practice, in two ways :
  * A pen plotter is a functional drawing tool able to produce posters, publications, maps, diagrams, cartographies and typography. This tool will expand and nourish my practice as an artist and graphic designer. I am enthusiastic about being able to plot complex images that emphasise vector graphics (as opposed to pixel images) as a means for digital imagery. Researching digital imagery<sup>1</sup> and drawing software tools<sup>2</sup> is core to my practice as a media artist.

  * Secondly, the visible parts and performative nature of a pen plotter make an ideal object for digital literacy workshops. As stated in my research question, I am exploring the use of tangible and physical technology to demystify the fast paced, digital world we find ourselves in. My research during projects such as Relearn<sup>3</sup> and recent activity with education group BeMaker<sup>4</sup> show promising results in this area. A clear finding of my research is the necessity to root digital learning in *experiences*. This is best achieved in collaborative learning environments. I am not alone in researching this question, some of the most successful expressions of this idea are education initiatives using FabLabs to show students how computers, technology and design interact. These are thriving at the moment, with many Irish and international examples in existence.<sup>5</sup>

### Aims
* To design, prototype and build a modern technology three axis, gcode pen plotter.
* To publish open source documentation allowing others to learn from the findings of this build.
* To produce workshop in Carlow with this pen plotter as subject matter, output machine, performative tool as narrative drawing.

### Rationale
I am curious and exited about the industrial history of Carlow and the many industries and crafts that are still very active in the county. I hope that, through the development of public demonstrations in artistic and digital learning, I can gather excitement around home built machines, prototyping techniques and fablab-like practices in order to build future collaborations. Simultaneously, this project will provide the opportunity to:
* continue to develop my practice as a visual and media artist making imagery, posters, graphs, etc
* as a new resident of Carlow, to establish my ongoing practice as a media artist and showcase this tool to local community members and local and national artists
* maintain an international practice (through the publishing of documentation) among artists, media artists and makers internationally
* conduct research in open source software for resin 3d printing techniques in rapid prototyping
* use and document cutting edge software libraries made for artists and engineers to build their own machines such as the smoothieboard controller / smoothieware software combination
* be in line with the Creative Youth plan from Creative Ireland, pillar 1 : enabling coding and computational thinking for all children across the country with a view for digital literacy becoming an embedded part of the Irish primary and secondary school curriculum.<sup>6</sup>

### Audience
Ideally, when this project is completed, I would like the pen plotter to live in a publicly accessible community space. While I have outlined benefits of this tool personal to my practice, my project would really be completed if community members could observe and use it. As a new resident of County Carlow, I am unable to determine if such a space may already exist or be appropriate for such an action, but I am keen to enter into dialog with the Council to realise this.

* Local interest in the machine has been expressed by The VISUAL Curator Emma Lucy O'Brien who is aware of my practice with this type of tool, and I am in conversation to organise a demonstration in the gallery.

* I am currently developing a support structure for coding and technology-focused community initiatives with Carlow County Development Partnership. CCDP has asked me to meet with existing community groups and establish new projects which would focus on coding, STEAM and technology with young  people in disadvantaged rural parts of the county I will be coordinating this research with the aim to enable other local communities to initiate their own or join existing technology and coding clubs and in this way create an enthusiasm for digital ideas among young people, especially in rural and isolated parts of the county. My extended goal with this coordinating role is to attempt to cross technology, coding and arts. I believe the pen plotter to be one ideal representation of what this cross section can be.

* Reaching out to art colleges, graphic design schools and universities is also something I am interested in. I have been in conversation with students from the Dublin Institute of Technology discussing open source graphic design. Specifically members of the media design course have expressed interest in a workshop utilising pen plotters. I am also hoping to establish something similar in the Carlow Institute of Technology.

### Evidence of my ability to deliver this project
I received a BA in Design and Communication from ENSAV La Cambre, Brussels in 2013 and an MA in Media Design from the Piet Zwart Insitute, Rotterdam in 2017. My master thesis focused on digital crafts and what it means to consider oneself a craftsperson using mostly computer tools. I am part of a research collective focused on Open Source graphic design and publication called Open Source Publishing<sup>7</sup>. This collective searches for ways to practice digital graphic design away from the confines of proprietary software such as the Adobe suite or the Windows / macOSx platforms. As a member of OSP I have initiated *Relearn*<sup>3</sup>, an experiment in collaborative education. Relearn describes itself as a school that has as many teachers as it has students. I have also lead multiple third-level workshops both as an independent researcher and a member of OSP. During most of 2018 I was education coordinator for the non profit organisation beMaker. The project we lead was based on two mobile fab labs (food trucks converted to function as Fabrication Laboratories) that we drove to schools all around Belgium. This initiative was hugely successful in establishing hands-on experiences with technology for 8 to 16 year olds. I have moved to Carlow in January 2019 from Belgium and am keen to continue my practice here.


### Collaborators
This project will be self led, but will benefit from new and ongoing collaborations with various groups; some directly on the subject of pen plotters, some on the research around digital imagery and others on the possible printed outputs of the plotter. My supporting documents include details on the projects and collaborations below :

* Julien Dutertre : an artist and designer based in Belgium is my main collaborator on this project. Together we have built and modified several 2 and 2.5 axis machines such as laser cutters and mini CNC mills. Julien has already begun designing the machine, building upon open electronics and build standards and has a functional prototype in Brussels. Part of the budget detailed as part of this application is to document and publish the technical documents for others to build their own pen plotters.
* beMaker : Until very recently I was education coordinator in the Brussels based digital education project beMaker. This project is currently paused as it came to the end of its funding cycle. Meanwhile, the founders of beMaker, remain interested in new ways of approaching digital litteracy learning moments as this project proposes. Julien Dutertre is a founding member of this organisation.
* Open source Publishing : OSP is a research collective based in Brussels of which I am a founding member. OSP thinks and acts around questions of Open Source graphic design, publishing and licencing of imagery, typography and publications. As part of the collective we have developed many workshops using older restored pen plotters.
* Loop studio Brussels : Collaborative Artists and designers of Loop Studio in Brussels were among the few beta testers of the Brussels prototype. The artists at Loop studio (including graphic designers, typographers, print makers and performers) helped us solve many assembly and technic
* OpenStreetMaps Ireland : Openstreetmaps is a collaborative project to create a free editable map of the world. As such, most forms of maps are not something the community or the user can contribute to. Openstreetmaps turns that notion around and believes locals are the best people to map their surroundings. This worldwide project has hundreds of national chapters and Ireland is no exception. One of the mentioned exiting potentials of a pen plotter is its ability to make custom maps. The data used to make these maps originates from Openstreetmaps. I am in touch with the Irish community of OSM members and will be joining the next gathering, cartography aware people will be valuable aids to continue my ongoing research around pen plotted maps.
* THRIECE partnership : Erasmus+ funded research group on Teaching for Holistic, Relational and Inclusive Early Childhood Education have consulted me in support of the Irish led section of the research: relational education. The group has found that in their study of existing relational education techniques, the use of diagrams and schematics help them explain and analyse types of relations and their effects. Specifically, the order in which actors and elements appear in diagrams has a large incidence. While this is ongoing research out of my field, I will be proposing a narrative schematic technique I employed during my studies. The act of having the schematic drawn out by the pen plotter is an exiting new possibility that I would like to push.
* Design CORE IT Carlow : the 3d printing specialist of the design group has expressed interest in the project and has offered expertise in file calibration towards optimal printing results.

Apart from the aforementioned interests in this project relating to my established practice, the quest for better ways to share, teach and educate students towards digital literacy can be aided by my proposal to cross technology and arts by building this drawing machine.
