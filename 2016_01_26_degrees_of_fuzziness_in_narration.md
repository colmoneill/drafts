# Degrees of fuzziness in narration

I'll write this in a blog post format, because this is the type of address that is the closes to written speech, at least for me; I'll use the time afforded now to reflect on a meta aspect of this thematic project theme: the deliberateness of fuzziness or intentional degrees of deliberate opaqueness, or a title riffing on this idea that fuzziness is a parameter, and that one could chose to embrace it, or chose to sway as far away as possible from it.

I just thought I'd write these thoughts down, and I wouldn't burden myself with trying to come up with an interesting form. Somehow, that seems more honest, comming from me.

So we broke for lunch and we taken apart a few methods that Cha used to display B to us while actually speaking about A. I made a note that went something along the lines of *So, relativity, or relatability*. I don't really think we spoke about this yet, or at least not directly.

I'll reconstruct: narration is the the tool we use to get messages across. Or feelings, or ideas, or whatever. A tool to enable expression. There is a part of me that wonders why we actually would do anything to impair the clarity of the message we are emitting.

This is probably not going to constitute a very interesting intervention when we eventually come back together and present.

So maybe you don't want to be understood. Because you're lying. Because you believe that displaying the lie will ultimately show what you *actually want to say* better than you could have by using direct address.

Would it not have worked if Cha had written directly, and plainly about the themes she only eluded to? She hides messages and some people pick up on those messages, and may attain to the *real* topic she wants to speak about, but what about the ones that get don't get struck by the hidden messages?

If I, as a reader, don't see the message you hid inside, am I at fault, or are you the guilty one for not shaping your message properly?

These ideas are also clearly nourished by the brainwashing that is graphic design training: you are given a message, you are paid to get this message across. And that's it.

So is design the polar opposite of performance art? Performance art being a mix of preparation, construction and finger crossing (hoping that what you indend to say actually get's across?)

We're facing this dilemma right now: should I perform in front of you right now, or should I stick to what I think might work best for the sake of communication?

I guess I'm confronting the honesty of direct address with the risk of fuzziness.

Yeah, but doing something different is good, right, get out of your comfort zone? Ok but no, I'm not interested in difference, I'm interested in bettering myself, and bettering myself first means resolving this in written form. In pensive form. In logical form, in arguable form.
