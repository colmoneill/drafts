# Degrees of fuzziness in narration

I'll write this in a blog post format, because this is the type of address that is the closes to written speech, at least for me; i'll use the time afforded now to reflect on a meta aspect of this thematic project theme: the deliberateness of fuzziness or intentionnal degrees of deliberate opaqueness, or a title riffing on this idea that fuzziness is a parameter, and that one could chose to embrace it, or chose to sway as far away as possible from it.
