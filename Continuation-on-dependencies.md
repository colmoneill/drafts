Just came out of a presentation of Annet Dekker's work, in which she spoke in various flavors about achiving, the misunderstanding of, and the possible required mind shift to accommodate such an idea.

Annet spoke about a piece she wrote for the tate about dependencies. She did not go into very much detail about this, but it seems that the text tries to deal with the various aspects of technical and non technical dependencies required to maintain a project.

While I do not know the scope or outcomes of this piece yet, it did enable questions around why it is so complex to understand (why it is so difficult for your typical everyday person to understand) the complexity of the necessary scheme for net art, media art, software art, to be maintained.

The word litteracy is mentionned. In the first context, visual litteracy, in this context, software litteracy.

This got me thinking about why digital litteracy is not growing as our everyday lives get more and more involved with networked, digital and computed aspect.

Rough structure:
- You do not have to understand every single layer of a computing system to be able to maintain it.
- There is an urgency, well beyond software art maintenance, for a redevelopment of digital literacy.
- Computing is complex. Computers help us deal with complexity. Computers are not an ends mean, they are tools and therefor they should give back as much as they take. This point has the aim of introducing the next topic of interface.
- Interface are to blame
  - A two faced machine one looking at you, the other looking at the circuit boards
  - Any interface that tries to make your life easier by hiding layers of complexity of the task you are trying to achieve has a responsibility to textually inform you of what it is trying to do for you. Transparently
  - File systems are not that complex. Their vocabulary comes from the physical world. Anybody can understand these concepts. Any system that tries to make the file system easier then it actually is, has a direct responsibility to inform you of what and why.
  - Software has a responsibility. If software is used as a marketing tool, this process should be made obvious.
  - Tactile interfaces are not an excuse.
