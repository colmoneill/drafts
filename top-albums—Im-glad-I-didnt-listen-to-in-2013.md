Top albums —I'm glad I didn't listen to— 2013

While the big blogs are all putting out their early lists, there is good perspective on the year in music. We were warned, and we can't have been disappointed, 2013 will go down as a very dense year.

Meanwhile, I can but notice how much of the music we got this year has been overhyped, while the real quality stuff was left at the bottom of the pile. I have my interests in music and I have my dislikes. Mainly dislikes. Here are some albums that came out this year, that I'm glad I did not spend any time on:

Kanye Fucking West
Too much chitter chatter. 
Childish Gambino
Lady Gaga
Justin Timberlake
Daft Punk
The National
Arcade Fire
