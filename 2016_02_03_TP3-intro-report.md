intro
=====

The task at hand here is to explain the mode of address of the *report*
of this thematic project: **Navigating Borders and Contours: From Direct
Address to Fuzzy Narrators** but not introduce the *topic itself*. We
write this report as means to keep trace of, give access to and in a
sense, archive the happenings. We're doing this for ourselves (the
participants / students) but also for who ever you may be, reading this
now.

We found ourselves shortening the name of the thematic to a simple
'Fuzzy Narrators', because the full title is long, but also because the
two word version encapsulates a majority of the items raised, while
remaining blurry enough to truly represent the vastness and
intangibility of the theme. It's about fuzziness, in narration. It's
about narrators being fuzzy. Interchange accordingly.

We viewed and discussed a set of pieces that purposefully used non
clarity as a means to tell, or in some cases, untell stories. Texts were
read, in order to nourish the talks and discussions we had about these
techniques. For a more factual point of view on items, readings, pieces,
see the 'archive' section at the end of this page.

Meanwhile, we chose to embrace the topic of the project, in the form of
this report, and give non factual accounts of the personal experiences
of the three days spent together. We're keeping a minimal structure, one
of chronology, but the rest is up to the individual reporter. *We're
putting things inside envelopes.*
