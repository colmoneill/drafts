There is a track called like this, 5am spiritual, I think it's from interpol, or maybe Real Estate, I can't find it by searchign for it, so I'll just have to look it up online when I get a connection.

Forget it, I found it, it's actually Smith Westerns, and it's called 3am spiritual, which is fine, but it's actually 5 am right now, so, sorry.

I did just listen to an entire Simon and Garfunkel record, and it put me in a great mood. I'm in the night bus from Brussels to Rotterdam, which I just found out includes a stop over in Breda, making it the least efficient trip over imaginable.

We had the OSP AGM last night, I think I'm still quite pumped from it. I also slept a few hours before getting this bus, a combination I have known to confuse my body to no end. Anyway, somethink like 40 minutes are left on this bus for me, so I thought it might be time for one of my ramble articles.

There is lots to do still for OSP. LOTS to do. Practically and conceptually. And also in terms of the group realising it is still a group, made of individuals, working together, finding the right balance between self expression and internalising opinions in favor of efficiency.

Had a few randomly laced together thoughts before pulling the computer out; I'll try and re-itterate them somehow quick:
I now realise how little I miss design practice, but that I must maintain it as in the image making skill that I had one honed but am slowly loosing touch with. This is not similar to code languages practice. I don't seem to forget them. I still get enjoyment from them too, and great power comes along with that ability, I can't forget to maintain the similar power that comes with being able to finish an image, finish a drawing, adjust it for a situation. Mapping is the only real graphic design practice I have had recently. This I do enjoy. Need to continue exploring GraphViz also.

Leading away from that was the idea of a jack of all trades and a master of none. Sort of brought up by my Dad asking me in quite a light, non worring way: so what *are* you going to do after this? Top 5 dream jobs:

* Full time OSP researcher; something about making a project work almost from the ground up, and long term comittment.
* Project manager at Mozilla
* Code & design education program manager
* PhD student; ok not a job, but still probably a way of working
* public advocate, activist for the FSF, or similarly tangential organisation.
