# notes after a shower

## black boxing

Aymeric's suggestions were to be more specific in my examples, look into one chain of black boxes, and explain what the issues were with each of their borders.

I just remembered an analogy that Pierre Marchand made in the train on the way back to Brussels after my first time in Rotterdam, for LGRU: He said he studied forestry before making software. I giggled and said how harsh a turn that seemed to be. He said it wasn't, he explained that software and nature are the same, if you're willing to peel the layers, you can understand everything.

Quite pretty example, but also a study case telling about natural interfaces also. Tapping birch trees for sap. Tapping maple trees in Canada. if you peel the bark of a tree off, you find moisture and lighter fibers. If you cross cut a tree, you can count the growth rings and see how many turns of seasons the tree has been through. There is a front end, above the ground, and a back end, underground.

The difference is though, that when you first see a tree, you only see the front end, but so little is stopping you from understanding more from it. Maybe it's bendy, maybe it's dead, maybe it's too big to put your hands around, but it talks to you. Break off a branch, and you understand how, with time, this smaller, maybe greener growth will become so much more robust and solid, later on.

There is a good comparison to software here.

## relative units

Joanna started me off on this 'topic' with a question about organic units. Forwarding the question along, it's widening to pifom√©trie, kayak makers, and inches. Inches, feet, relative units that got standardised, or stabilised at a point in time.

Then the scollometer and a slide of hand towards a compulsive desire to quantify everything, and wanting to measure everything and make everything count, and accountable. So here comes a prototype for me to bragg my scrolling activity, because I think I should be applauded for the amount of distance I cover every day in my online feeds.
