# Scrolling
### outline
Scrolling on screens is an action that can be directly matched up to progress points in computer and network history. This illusion needs unpacking.

### structure
* Etymology
* The illusion
* Scrolling vs panning

* parallax trends

What are the metrics of this space? According to which parameters do we change the sizes of the scrollable areas? Is it problematic that we may not all see the information the same way? We're progressing to a computer world where touch interactions are as important if not more
