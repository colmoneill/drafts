Scrolling
=========

### outline

Scrolling on screens is an action that can be directly matched up to
progress points in computer and network history. This illusion needs
unpacking.

introduction
------------

It was a small sentence, in a casual conversation on a lazy weekend
afternoon in the studio, after a statement of not really having
accomplished much on that day yet, except maybe scrolling a few miles
before getting out of the house. I'd never thought of it that way,
scrolling, in terms of distance. Nor had I really spent any time
thinking about it, it's so ubiquitous, scrolling. You know, that thing
you do with your thumb, or your index, on that screen. Like the tire on
a car, or the shoe on the foot, the point that touches the thing that
makes the other bit move.

A scroll is a roll of parchment, papyrus, or paper, which has been drawn
or written upon.\[1\] The noun *scrolling* means the continuous movement
of text or images on a display screen in either a horizontal or vertical
direction. We tend to take the exploratory nature of the scrolling
action for granted, a lot of web page design depends on the user being
willing to move their viewport up and down the sequence of information.

But what are the metrics of this space? Are their any? Do they depend on
the screen you're using? According to what parameters do we change the
sizes of the scrollable areas? Is it problematic that we may not all see
the information the same way? We're leaning towards a computer world
where touch interactions are as important as mouse and keyboard ones.
What is their to be said about scrolling?

the illusion
------------

Let's start off with reminding ouselves that this is in quite some ways,
an illusion. We're now discussing an interaction method, thought up to
solve a spacial issue. The one of more content than physical space. It's
not a new issue, and the word remind us of this, rolling up a long piece
of text to make the partial and logical reading action easy is a good
way of dealing with a spacial constraint. But is this what is happening
in my browser when I read along an article? Am I alone in wondering what
happens to the videos or gif loops I opened up in my twitter feed, then
moved along? Do they play for eternety?

Today, the workings of scrolling are well established, but in the period
of time when computers were developping to we now know

It is therefor possible to think of scrolling in a narrative sense

The idea that such a space might deserve to be measured has different
levels of legibility. We have established how scrolling as an action has
become easier, technically, but what about the content that the action
enables. Is there a relationship between the quantity of available
scrollable real estate and the quality of the content under your thumb?
This remark is unlightly to be a result of the development of the
scroll, but we can at least say that as content becomes more plentiful
online, it's interesting that scrolling is available to interface the
quantities.
