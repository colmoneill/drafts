This started as a prototype, and an excuse to learn Javascript, but is turning out to be much more revealing that I first thought. Scrolling on screens is an action that can be directly matched up to progress points in computer and network history. It is an illusion that I want to unpack, and have the essay live beside the more demonstrative prototype.

* Etymology
* The illusion
* Scrolling wasn't always as easy as it is now
* Timelines
* The responsibility of touch screens:
  * their portrait orientation
  * their limited interactions
* speed readings
* changing history: remembering context over content
* fax paper metaphor
* binge scrolling & distances covered
