#cyclical comfort
### a text on methods

A major part of how I attribute value to a work is how much flexibility, modularity and scalability has been considered. My belief is that all [art]work is actually a craft, and it's the makers responsibility to at least conceptually, elude to the (common / best) practices of said craft, being both backwards and forwards looking. The attibution of value in digital practices and products is complex, but I believe that the industry is now mature enough to be viewable under this specter. 

Methods are ways of doing. Doing good, or doing fast, or doing well. Methods are transferable, they can be taught and learned, or they can be made up. They lead to a certain comfort, a confidence in the making, an asset that is interesting, but might well also be worth questioning.

My practices as a researcher and communications maker are mostly anchored in digital processes. This means they both depend on and work only thanks to semi automated software processes. I will argue my opinion on the need for constant (cyclical) reviewing of these practices in order to continue progress, and the comfort compromises that need to be made in order to accommodate this unstable practice. Later, items that fold into this topic and that will be addressed here are efficiency, individuality and ownership.
