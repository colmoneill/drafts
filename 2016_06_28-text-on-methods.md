#cyclical comfort
### a text on methods

A major part of how I attribute value to a work is how much flexibility, modularity and scalability has been considered in its making. My belief is that all [art]work is indeed a craft, and it's consequently the makers responsibility to —at least conceptually— elude to the (common / best) practices of said craft, being both backwards and forwards looking. The attibution of value in digital practices and products is complex, but I believe that the industry is now mature enough to be viewable under this specter.

Methods are ways of doing. Doing well, or doing fast, or doing properly. Methods are transferable, they can be taught and learned, or they can be made up. They may lead to a certain comfort, a confidence in the making, an asset that is interesting, but might well also be worth questioning.

My practices as a researcher and communications maker are mostly anchored in digital processes. This means they both depend on and work only thanks to semi automated software processes. It is my opinion that digital practitioners need to constantly (cyclically) review of their practices in order to continue to progress, along with the comfort compromises that need to be made in order to accommodate this unstable practice.

Key words: comfort, efficiency, ownership, individuality

### digital crafts

It is an unfortunate consequence of the organisation of user intended software that computational processes are hidden away behind interfaces. One could argue that there is no direct need for the workings of a system language to be immediately visible for the person using a spreadsheet on a computer for example. My belief is that because of this hiding away, a disconnection is created between the cultural origins of the program and it's user. Of course, I consider the functional and spacial difficulty for a program *interface* to expose it's process to the end user, but the total opaqueness of the system runnings to the user, quite often results in a rift between the offerings of the program and how it proceeds, that can't be explained as anything else than magic.

This disconnect repeats itself broadly across software and personal computers. All these magical rifts come together and often make it inpenetrable for a 'regular' user to gain access to the raw materials and formats that lay underneath her or his programs and files. My observations are that because of this constant rift, a large portion of *regular users* see software as a highly engineered, extremely complex field that only science can manipulate. I'm not here to say that that is totally wrong. However, I'm convinced that if less time was spent on making interface sleek and smooth and more attention was given to revealing the sequences that a mouse clicking on a button launches, for example, there would be a large gain in understanding how parts of programs work. Later then, with experience, a user might notice how different programs call same routines, similar processes, either at similar instigations or possibly on the usage of different functions.

This was a proposal of how we could make software more tangible for the regular user, which would result in the understanding that digital practitioners, software makers, are only different to the *regular computer user* in that they, we have dug a little deeper into the matter. I hope to establish the understanding that *doing* and *making* with digital is indeed a practice, and that, as with any other practice, if done *well*, it should lead to it being considered a craft.

### modularity = flexibility

I introduced the idea of value placement. This rather long detour to speak about methods is necessary in order to speak about good work, what I think good work is, and the methods I employ to try and make it, and to keep it interesting.

In carpentry, a craftsman will often review his joints from project to project, refining each fit, choosing and adjusting each technique to best fit the project's situation.
