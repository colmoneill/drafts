#cyclical comfort
### a text on methods

A major part of how I attribute value to a work is how much flexibility, modularity and scalability has been considered in its making. My belief is that all numerical [art]work is indeed a craft, and it's consequently the makers responsibility to —at least conceptually— elude to the (common / best) practices of said craft, being both backwards and forwards looking. The attibution of value in digital practices and products is complex, but I believe that the industry is now mature enough to be viewable under a spectrum.

Methods are ways of doing. Doing well, or doing fast, or doing properly. Methods are transferable, they can be taught and learned, or they can be made up. Most often they are adaptations and combinations. They may lead to a certain comfort, a confidence in the making, an asset which is interesting, but might well also be worth questioning.

My practices as a researcher and communications maker are mostly anchored in digital processes. This means they both depend on and work only thanks to semi automated software processes. It is my opinion that digital practitioners need to constantly (cyclically) review of their practices in order to continue to progress, along with the comfort compromises that need to be made in order to accommodate this unstable practice.

Key words: comfort, value, efficiency, ownership, individuality

### digital crafts

It is an unfortunate consequence of priorities in user intended software that computational processes are hidden away behind interfaces. One could argue that there is no direct need for the workings of a system language to be immediately visible for the person using common desktop software. My belief is that this hiding away creates a disconnection between the cultural origins of the program and it's users actions. Of course, I understand the difficulty for a programs *interface* to expose it's process to the end user, as well as give access to function, but the total opaqueness of the systems runnings for the user results in a rift. A space then exists between the offerings of the program and how it proceeds. What happens can't be explained, but works, so it becomes magic.

This disconnect repeats itself broadly across software and personal computers. All these magical rifts come together and often make it impenetrable for a *regular user* to peer into the raw materials and formats that lay underneath her or his programs and files. My observations are that because of this constant rift, a large portion of *regular users* view software as a highly engineered, extremely complex field that only science can manipulate. I'm not here to say that that is totally wrong. However, I'm convinced that if less time was spent on making interface sleek and more attention was given to revealing the sequences that a mouse clicking on a button launches, for example, there would be a large gain in understanding how parts of programs work. Later, a user could notice how different programs call same routines, similar processes, either at similar instigations or possibly on the usage of different functions. I wish programs showed us their sequences, instead, vendors seem to be busy with rebranding their products as applications.

This suggests a model for how software could become more tangible for the *regular user*, which would result in the understanding that digital practitioners, lower language software users, are only different to the *regular computer user* in that they, we, have dug a little deeper into the matter. I hope to establish the understanding that *doing* and *making* on computers is indeed a culturally crafted and culture crafting practice —albeit one that depends on complex physics and mathematics— but also one that, thanks to this power, includes, extends and acts to develop cultures.

### modularity = flexibility

This disambiguation speaks to one of the introductions first claims about value. The recontextualisation of digital practices within active cultures is also partially about redefining where value is derived from. In short this would be to say that value comes through practice, then a minor extension gives: good value comes from good practice, a not so far relative of *best practice*. I believe it is a strategy to pick and develop methods to aim for best practices within my fields. I aim to make projects that are modular and forwards looking. Maybe if a piece of code is well written enough, if it is flexible enough, then it can serve purpose in the next project, or at least serve as a basis. Specifically, this can mean choosing a certain type of language processor over an other, focusing on how adaptable the situation could later be. The last decade has seen the appearance of preprocessors (meta programs that add programming functionnality) for declarative languages (code languages that expect the language to work within a specific dictionary, and not beyond) which is encouraging to be contemporary with, as a practice.

Building projects modularly demands a great attention to one's tools. Often, a digital craftsman will also keep and maintain a set of sub-tools, routines or functions that can be passed over from project to project. Little snippets that can be called upon to  sole a reoccurring problem. In this way, I see many common points again between digital and manual crafts. The caveat though is that some of the latest appearances in digital tools follow the application focused attitude described above. In ways, they set their own boundaries and reduce their potential scope because of the way they act, perform and the realms of culture they wish to live within. These newer tools, be they graphical or code based are what is called proprietary software. This tooling model is one where the original maker of the tool has had a recognition for the value of their work, but decides to displace it as not a culturally included body of work, but more as an item that can be leveraged in a service model for revenue. This ownership model is one where I am invited to use but not modify, which in no way abides to my quest for deep modularity, therefor I chose former methods, ones that prise themselves on keeping all layers of the tool open for use and modification (often enough these will even encourage the redistribution of ones modifications in the interest of widening the culture).

Modularity then is my first chosen method, on the two levels I descibed above, both within the creation and maintenance of sub tools, and in the choice of umbrella processes.
