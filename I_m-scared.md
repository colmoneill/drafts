# I'm scared.

## Don't cringe, this post is going to be about privacy. Your favourite kind of privacy, the hot and topical digital privacy.

It's now a known fact, retaining privacy while using the internet is impossible. So why would one waist energy trying to claim back a little personal space online when it is such an uphill battle? In a nutshell: **integrity**.

My point of view on this general topic is clearly not bullet proof. There are many loopholes, and arguments I can't battle again, but I'll try an expose one perspective of why I am looking for ways to fight back, and stay off the records.

The all to easy, pre-packaged excuse of not caring for internet privacy, 

> because I have nothing to hide 

is laughable. I can not take this claim seriously because it is clearly not true. For this purpose I'll reuse Glenn Greewald's answer; Then why do you use passwords? If you have nothing to hide, then ship over your password to me and let me snoop around your years of email archive, related documents and interactions. All I want to do is send your stuff to a couple of people, publish some of it, cross reference your usage with other passwords I have, et me just have a quick peek, after all **you've got nothing to hide!** 

While this answer Greenwald gives is purposely amusing, it has a ring of truth to it, so keep this in mind because I believe there may well be a good idea in there in some form. That being said, we can't just put the reused claim to bed with this.
