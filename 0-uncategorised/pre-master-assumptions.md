# Pre-master assumptions

bBelow are a list of assumptions. They are items I believe to be able to explain, but they have not yet received enough attention to be able to be made into givens. They lack context and flesh, but meanwhile;

- Interface is a two faced machine
- Tools Shape Practice
- Proprietary software is a no no

## Interface is a two faced machine
When following a digital procedure, one will, in many cases, have to deal with an interface. On most kind of devices, a graphical interface is overplayed to help us achieve tasks. The screen presents us with a set of human readable actions and options, that are then translated by the interface into actions, that the computer system can run and return to the interface with information to display.

This interface is 

## Tools Shape Practice
In most artisan fields, the tools one uses have a specific purpose. They are designed for a circumstance, and for a job recurrent enough to merit direct attention. This is still true beyond artisans. It is true for labour, for technique,  and for most professional fields.

The manual tools we use can be adapted, combined, broken, fixed and customized to function better, or more specifically according to a given situation. My current practice involves computers. Computations, or software in general is not always very helpful at letting us fix and customize it.

This adaptability and craftsmanship can not be ignored in the case of software. A practice that involves computers should have the same adaptability, and possibility of customizations that any manual task has.

## Proprietary software is a no no
With customization of tools in mind, it is, in this assumptions opinion, no stretch to accept that a tool that can not share it's inner processes, can not be a tool that is considerable. Proprietary software is a model, often linked to a commercial model, that delivers a software product as is. A finished installer package that has one use case: to be ran, in this version, and with no alterations to the.

The alternate case is a model where sources are distributed and proceeding are shared. Out in the open. For all to review. This does not stop an open source software vendor from also distributing 'frozen' installations versions of said code and sources.

I am not able to understand all of this code, what it does, or to what part of the program it may refer to. But it is an important statement for a software distributor to give out it's sources and be able to prove that it's program is doing what it was meant to do, and not run (malicious?) side tasks.
