Things that I should talk about at the assessment next Monday:

* Drawing Curved being finished? Explain full context, LGRU, etc?
* Van Abbe proposal?
* making a free OV chipkaart reloader
* Lissajous project
* Hodology as a progressive research practice
* Structure mapping
  * the shift from a structural modal towards a decentralised one and what it means for privacy
  * I tried mapping things in structures and sequences, but it's not really so anymore, or at least, that view on things does not serve my issues
  * The upstream does not exist
  * Nudge theory
  * Recondidering my maps with the views of Harroway, and the metaphors of optics; diffraction, refraction, reflections
  * Karen Barad & Harroway
* then the issues of representationalism
