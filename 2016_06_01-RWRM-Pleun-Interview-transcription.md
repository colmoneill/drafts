**Colm O'Neill : ** *Ok Pleun, we were just talking about Control Societies versus Disciplinary Societies, actually are they opposites?*

**Pleun Gremmen : ** I don't think they are opposites, because they are more versions of society previous to these, but it's more of a slow change where I actually don't believe that the disciplinary part of the society will ever actually totally, go away, totally dissapear. But I believe that we're moving slowly towards this society of control more and more where, the disciplinary part, like the institutions, the strict rules connected to those institutions will slowly be less important.

** CO : ** *Ok, so before we go any further, now I need your understandings of these two types of societies...*

** PG : ** Yeah so for me, a disciplinary society revolves around this institutionalised world where every bit of our life sort of revolves around a separate institution. So in a normal day, you travel from institution to institution, a child might go to school, then a library, a family in itself is also kind of an institution with it's own separate habits and rules.

A society of control is different to that, because it's way more of a flowing thing where I imagine flows of capital, information, data, and that data flow gives access to certain things that you might only be able to get within institutions. For instance, now learning can happen online, make an account, give away some information about yourself, give some data, and in return you get some information back, or you learn something.

** CO : ** *Is it right to say that you are using these two models to look at other cultures, network cultures, internet cultures?*

** PG : ** That's kind of true, yeah, I'm writing an essay at the moment about these two forms and also how you place yourself into those, and then I'm also trying to link some projects to it.

** CO : ** *I ask because, a bit buyist, I have an idea of the domains you're working in, but not so precisely. There was something you said earlier, that I'm going to ask you about again, is it through these two societies maybe, but you said, "How free am I?". *

** PG : ** Well, eary into this research for the essay, I remembered this story that my parents told me, about myself as a child, about two years old. When my parents were building the house I grew up in, we had the plot, with a lot of sand on it. As a two year old, I wasn't at school yet, I was just around all day. Then a concerned neighbor passed by and asked my mum if she wasn't afraid that she'll run away because there are no fences, you're not around all the time, because you're managing the building process, etc. She replied no, we'll just draw a big circle in the sand around her, tell her not to leave, then she won't. Like I was a child that would obey, I would not go out of that circle.

** CO : ** *And your mum trusted that, 100%. And you didn't run away.*

** PG : ** No. And in the story it's kind of nice, but in a way I also have a problem with that, and it reminded me quite a lot of this disciplinary society that you just in this system, closed spaces with rules, and you follow them, before you leave it to go to an other closed space with another set of rules. So then I started to feel the need to break out of that, because I don't think I've changed that much since back then. I still have to push myself a lot to break rules. So I feel like I should do something with that, it's a mirror to our society. A lot of people still stuck in that form, while we're clearly moving to a new way of dealing with borders, and spaces, and how we move through those spaces.

** CO : ** *So it's introspective at first, but you've seen echoes of this in your proximity. It starts with you but you see it mirrored around you too?*

** PG : ** Yeah, which is why I'm doing this project.

** CO : ** *Yes, let's talk about what you're preparing now, which is in a domain that I don't think you've practiced much. You're thinking of making a perfomance? Something performance based? About challenging one of these boundries?*

** PG : ** Yes, quite literally. Using the surveillance domain, which links to this new form of society, so I'm testing my personal, but also boundaries that the city lays on me, doing that via the society of control, where they have cameras on you everywhere.

** CO : ** *So what is you're planning exactly?*

** PG : ** Practically I'm planning on going into the city, broad daylight, with not much more than a roll of tape, and being in front of an exiting security camera. I'm not sure of the location yet, because I need to figure out; do I want to have a location that is more secure, averagely secured, but I want to tape out on the street the square that in my understanding is being filmed, by the camera.

** CO : ** *The area on the ground that you think the camera, that you expect the camera to be capturing?*

** PG : ** Yes, then I want to place myself in that square, with a set of rules, which I'm still defining but I'm thinking that I need to exhaust myself in a way that given a certain amount of hours, I would not be able any longer. And then the
