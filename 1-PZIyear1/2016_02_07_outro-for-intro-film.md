Called this doc outro for intro film, in a fashion that, again, only speaks to me.

In my work on interface, I will be making a point that the evil that is sometimes hidden behind the non actions and the non education or dis-education though interface would not happen if there were a visual connection.

I think a lot of questionable issues have been brought up

I think there are a lot of questionable motivations behind actions done within interface today. I think that there are a lot of things that are done by social constructs, such as companies, that would not have taken place without these layers of abstraction.

A worker reports to a superior, lightly part of a team, itself a cog in a departments, responsible for one aspect of an organisations work. Each of these echelons are types of layers. Places for interaction and require interfacing. This is the amont point of view. From the aval, there are fewer individuals. These people usually have the most questionable morals. They sit on top of the pile, they hold the reins, and they care about profit, possibly exclusively profit.

This is one chapter of layers. There are quite a few others that come with the practicalities of distribution, retail, sales, marketing, and all of the other words I love. These chapters have a sequence, order of which distance us from all of the people that added elements to the product I use (I become).

I have faith in the individual, I truly believe that no one would act in this way deliberately, one on one. The only reason this passes, is because of all the chapters, all of the wrappers.

These brands don't sell us solutions they sell us ideologies, one of usability, and connectivity, and distribution, and beauty, and belonging. They offer constructs in answer to problems. They offer an attitude, not a resolve.

Here is the thing though. I know there is an other side. I understand now that computers are a reflection, one dimension, if only a facet, of human culture.

I am a jack of all trades, and a master of none.

So, to express this all out loud, then to make a video out of the thread, and then augment the speech with appropriate rhythm and additional footage.




##### I believe in better

This video is about interface. Interface is huge, it means almost everything and anything. Especially today. It's a field in it's own right, and it is the mediator between people, actions, and intent. And language is the portal.

*[shots of general purpose interfaces: dictionaries, door handles, tools, hand tools, steps, buttons, machines, shot of a person looking at the same thing from two perspectives, being inside, being outside, passing though things]*

I'm bothered by interfaces around me at the moment. I'm disturbed by the language that is used, and the motivations they hide. Interface has a job, and when I hear that someone or some group has spent time on the interface I take that as a promise, a deal, a hand opened up to me. When I see or am told that an interface has been designed, I expect that it does it's job, as best it can, as best as the people that designed it could, that and nothing else. That much would be really great already.

*[overhead shot of a blank page: future drawing, hand drawing different laptops & desktop computers & language & symbols]*

But what I see instead, is a hidden agenda, a second scenario, a narrative in which if I choose to use, I must follow the path layed out. I feel like I'm not in control. I feel like I'm not being told the story from the beginning.

*[This portion is read out facing the camera, handheld somewhere.]*

Ok so what I mean is that 'interface' is just an umbrella word. It points to a system. And like many system the interface system depends on a lot of smaller systems that tend to depend upon conventions.

*[Convention definition animation filming phone]*

Conventions are great. Conventions are sort of agreements. Acknowledgements made by people who notice that someone's idea works well, and that they are going to use that idea in their system too.

*[Read out by narrator also here]*

I'm getting ahead of myself here a little maybe. I'm just explaining that saying that interface is my topic, is a loaded statement. But let's zoom in a little. The context within which I am speaking is the one of software. A world where anything is possible, and you can give access to everything, to everyone, though computers and conventions(, and systems, and networks, and, you get the picture.) It's a huge promise and it's expanding all the time, as our systems evolve.

*[Read out by narrator also here]*

*[Screen filming time:]*

So here is the common difficulty: interfaces can be come complicated. Some software lets you do amazing things, incredible powerful things, unthinkable without the power of computers. But with all complexity, comes a necessity for adjacent knowledge.

*[screen filming of android pages of apps flying by, gnome apps, osx apps, ios apps,]*

Some of the complexity also comes from the fact that different situations might use different conventions in different manors. And that can be confusing, but never impossible to resolve with just a bit of concentration and attention. That's our side of the deal with the interface. We're ready to read, we're ready to learn, we want to use, so we know that we need to shift to a common ground.

We're ready to do this because we know that we are more powerful thanks to interface, and that if it wasn't there, we would all have to learn to write code in a handful of languages, to enable all of the things that we want our computers to do.

*[Copy and paste, keyboard shortcuts, ]*

*[make pause, fade to black, something to mark a stop]*

So as I said, I'm frustrated. I'm frustrated because I feel like a lot of the consumer software environment has gotten away with itself. It's taken on too much, in a way that is detrimental to the user. I feel like the most common computers around me today attempt to make things happen for me. It's said that they try and make thing easier for me, make my *experience* better. Well, that, dear listeners, is bullshit.

You can, indeed, work towards making an interface easier to use. That's great, and if that is really your goal, then brilliant, and thanks. But when a vendor is making it's software easier to use with a focus on experience, and ease, then I draw a line. The way you make an interface easier to use, is by making it more logical, by getting respectively closer, then further away from the field it gives access to, by explaining the way the program works, and the order in which you intended actions to happen, not by making me comfortable while I interact with the program.

Unfortunately though, this is the current focus of the major software vendors today. There is an emphasis on cleaning up, on unifying languages, on making everything look the same and act the same. The drive is to make things simpler, supposedly to make things easier, and by developing new habits, other conventions, but these conventions, are single use, they are patented devices.

My fear is that the strategies employed here have a hidden agenda, a benefactor, a very very grim silver lining. My fear is that by smoothing out the irregularities, by forcing conventions, by focusing more on experience than on procedure, we're loosing something. We're loosing diversity, and we're loosing clarity.

I truly see computers, as a reflection of human culture (unfortunately, sometimes for it's worst).  But it's amazing the advances that computers have given us, the forwards motion they have given to countless industries and the abilities they give each of us. I do see this culture being threated at the moment, by organisations that prioritise simplicity over logic. Companies think that they better enforce closed conventions rather than trust in the learning ability of the user.

This has lead me to understand that there is more than a good will at work here, there is more envolved than a group trying to better something. This is a strategy, these methods have a goal, and this goal is partly a creation of comfort, and partly a creation of enclosure.
