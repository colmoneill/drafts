### maybe it all fits together?

Interface gave way to research on black boxes. Initial thoughts are not about opening up the boxes, although some of them should / could be. Mostly this is about acknowledging that boxing things up is quite ok, but I'd like to find ways of at least seeing the structures, the orders and the masses, in order to better understand these systems.

Black boxes as the only mechanism available after a plain crash? Is there something ideological in calling it that way? We guess that the aircraft's black box is just a collection of computer logs, right? Is it even black? Why does it have such a mysterious name?

Meanwhile we're covering javascript in our prototyping class. And as an unknown language, I'm happy to start a project with the only excuse to practice, learn and understand. Roll in scrollo-meter. This prototype will be the subject of an essay in itself, but off the top of my head here is a list of items that could easily be unpacked & commented on:
* Scrolling wasn't always as easy as it is now
* Timelines
* The responsibility of touch screens:
  * their portrait orientation
  * their limited interactions
* speed readings
* changing history: remembering context over content
* fax paper metaphor
* binge scrolling & distances covered

I realize now that the idea of wedging in between boxes had been explained in [previous notes](2016_03_07_Monday-notes.md), so I'll concentrate on making the essays happen now.
