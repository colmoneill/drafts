# recap january 2016

Want to work out how we gain confidence in our tools (confidence leads to skill, skill leads to mastery, mastery leads to more curiosity) how we gain a better feeling and understanding for them, to ultimately gave tools as a gateway to bettering a craft or a field of work. Tools should enable production, practice brings mastery.

I am focused on this because all of the crafts I have properly invested myself into are channeled through on screen tools. Most of them are even planned to have an screen output. So when everything gets put through the same lens, the same view, the same glowing window, how are we to distinguish items, quality one, artistic productions, email, music, everything that passes through my computer, which is pretty much everything.

I fear a loss of context with the crafts that I practice going exclusively digital. They start on screen, and they finish on screen, they are talked about on screens, and they die on screens. In between is the production (my main focus) and then the consumption. All of this happens on the same computer, through the same browser, with the same basic interfacing, resulting in a tastlessness of everything, blandÂ².

In graphic design, I always strive for my productions to reveal, if only a tiny tiny bit, the process. A part of the work that went in should be visible, should be traceable. This is because graphic design is communications, and message shaping, and I can not consider doing this in a dishonest maner. Dishonesty, or lack of honesty, is enabled by destinator being invisible to the message shaper. While in (gd) school I also tried to apply this to my work, but usually to the despair of my teachers. I always try and reveal my thought process, or the production process, a way of making the actual work that happens visible. I'm realizing now that that is sort of a desperate call for attention, but that's to be dealt with in an other text.
