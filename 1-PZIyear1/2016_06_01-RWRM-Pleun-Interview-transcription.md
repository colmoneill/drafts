**Colm O'Neill : ** *Ok Pleun, we were just talking about Control Societies versus Disciplinary Societies, actually are they opposites?*

**Pleun Gremmen : ** I don't think they are opposites, because they are more versions of society previous to these, but it's more of a slow change where I actually don't believe that the disciplinary part of the society will ever actually totally, go away, totally dissapear. But I believe that we're moving slowly towards this society of control more and more where, the disciplinary part, like the institutions, the strict rules connected to those institutions will slowly be less important.

** CO : ** *Ok, so before we go any further, now I need your understandings of these two types of societies...*

** PG : ** Yeah so for me, a disciplinary society revolves around this institutionalised world where every bit of our life sort of revolves around a separate institution. So in a normal day, you travel from institution to institution, a child might go to school, then a library, a family in itself is also kind of an institution with it's own separate habits and rules.

A society of control is different to that, because it's way more of a flowing thing where I imagine flows of capital, information, data, and that data flow gives access to certain things that you might only be able to get within institutions. For instance, now learning can happen online, make an account, give away some information about yourself, give some data, and in return you get some information back, or you learn something.

** CO : ** *Is it right to say that you are using these two models to look at other cultures, network cultures, internet cultures?*

** PG : ** That's kind of true, yeah, I'm writing an essay at the moment about these two forms and also how you place yourself into those, and then I'm also trying to link some projects to it.

** CO : ** *I ask because, a bit buyist, I have an idea of the domains you're working in, but not so precisely. There was something you said earlier, that I'm going to ask you about again, is it through these two societies maybe, but you said, "How free am I?". *

** PG : ** Well, eary into this research for the essay, I remembered this story that my parents told me, about myself as a child, about two years old. When my parents were building the house I grew up in, we had the plot, with a lot of sand on it. As a two year old, I wasn't at school yet, I was just around all day. Then a concerned neighbor passed by and asked my mum if she wasn't afraid that she'll run away because there are no fences, you're not around all the time, because you're managing the building process, etc. She replied no, we'll just draw a big circle in the sand around her, tell her not to leave, then she won't. Like I was a child that would obey, I would not go out of that circle.

** CO : ** *And your mum trusted that, 100%. And you didn't run away.*

** PG : ** No. And in the story it's kind of nice, but in a way I also have a problem with that, and it reminded me quite a lot of this disciplinary society that you just in this system, closed spaces with rules, and you follow them, before you leave it to go to an other closed space with another set of rules. So then I started to feel the need to break out of that, because I don't think I've changed that much since back then. I still have to push myself a lot to break rules. So I feel like I should do something with that, it's a mirror to our society. A lot of people still stuck in that form, while we're clearly moving to a new way of dealing with borders, and spaces, and how we move through those spaces.

** CO : ** *So it's introspective at first, but you've seen echoes of this in your proximity. It starts with you but you see it mirrored around you too?*

** PG : ** Yeah, which is why I'm doing this project.

** CO : ** *Yes, let's talk about what you're preparing now, which is in a domain that I don't think you've practiced much. You're thinking of making a perfomance? Something performance based? About challenging one of these boundries?*

** PG : ** Yes, quite literally. Using the surveillance domain, which links to this new form of society, so I'm testing my personal, but also boundaries that the city lays on me, doing that via the society of control, where they have cameras on you everywhere.

** CO : ** *So what is you're planning exactly?*

** PG : ** Practically I'm planning on going into the city, broad daylight, with not much more than a roll of tape, and being in front of an exiting security camera. I'm not sure of the location yet, because I need to figure out; do I want to have a location that is more secure, averagely secured, but I want to tape out on the street the square that in my understanding is being filmed, by the camera.

** CO : ** *The area on the ground that you think the camera, that you expect the camera to be capturing?*

** PG : ** Yes, then I want to place myself in that square, with a set of rules, which I'm still defining but I'm thinking that I need to exhaust myself in a way that given a certain amount of hours, I would not be able to do it any longer. And set myself in a physical and mental mindset, to test the structure that is already there, to see if anybody is watching, and if I'll be taken away from the camera.

** CO : ** *So I want to ask you about all the parameters, you mentioned safe or secure areas, which is interesting, you also mentioned earlier some other parameters of where you would chose to do it, and then maybe we can go into how constraining, how strict your rules are going to be?*

** PG : ** I did do one step before when the project still really was about me, the conversation I was having with myself, about breaking certain laws, where I put myself in an environment that was as empty as possible. I put myself in this white space, nothing on the floor, walls, no distractions, there was a camera there, and then I stood in the center of the room, taped a square around my feet, like a quite tight one, and stood there for a half hour, without knowing how the time was passing, or how much had passed.

With that I wanted to see how my body and mind would react to that situation. But there, by putting the camera in there myself, there is still something in the project that doesn't click, that doesn't fit. I still was still in control of all parameters. So by giving some control away to what I believe to be the *society of control*. One of the most visible things of the society of control, in the city, are those cameras. Placing myself in front of those, while keeping the rules of standing there, I have to be as still as possible, no scratching, no walking, no talking, all these strict rules, I feel that I might be capturing both societies while testing them both as well.

** CO : ** *So if I try and ask again in a different way; the rules that you will set for yourself in this space, will not always be the same, according to the space. Is that right?*

** PG : ** That's exactly where some of my biggest questions are, I'm still really doubting if I want to do this action where I make the stage my own. Then, really simple things like not only taping out the square where the camera films, but maybe then also coloring it in with tape. Or physically making it my own by turning it into my living room or something silly like this. Or keep with what I have done before about testing my own body and mind with the strict rules. There test to see if they remove me, or that I fall over first. So between those two, I'm still in the dark, like what is more true to the project.

** CO : ** *So your ideas range at the moments of the rules, therefor the actions, or actually non actions, like the happenings maybe, during these sessions, go from quite outwards looking and aesthetic, to inwards looking and quiet from what you were saying, with the tape then things that would only involve you and your head. So do you know yet what else you're doing to make these new experiments different to the previous one?*

** PG : ** You can always make rules around *what happens if*, I guess in a way this is more used in practices like theater or other perfomance arts, where you don't only have rules about you do do, but also a set of reactionary rules, if this happens then, if that happens then react that way. And that requires more testing. But most things you can catch with that, at least enough in a way that it can work. Or you can make work in a way that you don't forsee, but you catch.

** CO : ** *Because you'll have to be reactionary if someone comes up, you'll have to react somehow.*

** PG : ** Also what I think is interesting here also, is that I usually think of the public in the sense of who is going to see my work but here it is quite direct, my main public is going to be the police which is something I really like, but also really a thinking point. And all this aspect of deciding wether or not I communicate with my public or not. I imagine that they are sitting in a room with all these little camera views, so am I performing this in one space, or can I leave little messages around the city that they then can see something happening when they combine these images. This is a separate group of questions, but they are relevant. Also time is something I can play with, which I am also thinking of.

** CO : ** *In regards to the question of who is it for, and how you communicate this, have you thought of how you want to capture how these experiments are happening? Because you're not sure you're going to be able to get the actual CCTV footage.*

** PG : ** The ideal situation is where I get the footage, I also really want to see how they transform it. These rules say that I should be able to ask footage back, when I'm on it myself. But the people that are around me and walk by, etc, that are probably going to cross the square I'm in, because it's public space, they can't be visible on the footage, so that would be interesting to see what that looks like. This is something I would not want to nor could even recreate. So ideally I would get the footage of that and then show it via this eye from above, from the camera. That is the preferred perspective.

But I also need to be kind of smart, I would have to capture it myself as well, which is also kind of nice, because then, you can see the the square I am taping out, better. Maybe from more of a public perspective. Because they are the two perspectives, the public and the police.

** CO : ** *But indeed also as a backup for the project?*

** PG : ** Yes, because as we were saying I already was able to ask a police officer, but he basically said that I'll never get it, no way, practically speaking.

** CO : ** *And then here a part of the project that we haven't yet spoken about, the challenge that you're issuing, in a discrete manor, or subtle manor.*

** PG : ** I need to investigate more and ask more direct questions, but I fear that then I just become 'that girl with art project'. So I might be a bit too doubtful about that part. But then I plan a strategy to go around this.

** CO : ** *Nice. We've gone overtime of course. But thanks*
