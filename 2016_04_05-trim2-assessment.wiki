Slowly moving towards a broader consideration of interface and black boxing. Was the clarity I was calling for just a result of logical development following a method of boxing tools &amp; utilities up? Are these boxes in a chain sequence or is it more organic? Where do I, the user, stand in this sequence?

The 'necessity' for such a system is clear, I'm glad one does not have to run each intricate item and dependency when executing a task. This model is not flawed or even really broken in any way. I'm looking at a logical consequence of this modeling: it's ''opaqueness''. (Looping back to this seems terribly logical. It is suddenly quite a simple point to be looking at my research from, but anyway.)

I'm putting aside the moralistic and fearful opinions I have voiced between the start of the year and now, in order to concentrate on projects that might generate discussion / opinions for the audience it self.

Anyway, in attempting to answer the question around the structure or sequence of the black boxes scheme, I collected a few examples of attempts of visualisations:

then I tried a few more basic ones, to actually see if I could draw out what I thought I knew * [[File:http://colm.be/owncloud/index.php/apps/files_sharing/ajax/publicpreview.php?x=1920&y=635&a=true&file=IMG_20160403_193533-crop.jpg&t=Z67Oix5H61DScVj&scalingup=0]]
