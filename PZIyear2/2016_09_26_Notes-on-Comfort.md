# Comfort

It's not the first time I come back to the issues of comforts when trying to unpack my [software issues](https://pzwiki.wdka.nl/mediadesign/User:Colm/RWRM-year2-Position#research_field), nor is it the first time I write [about it](https://pzwiki.wdka.nl/mediadesign/User:Colm/RW%26RS-cyclical-comfort-text-on-methods#on_comfort), but in this case, it feels a little different.

Being precise when choosing my thesis is the one piece of advice that has echoed widely, so if comfort was to be the over arching theme, comfort creation would be the second node to go to.

<small>These are only rapid notes, I'll draw on these, I publish these, but it's not a built text atm.</small>
