# Position restatement

###### context:
This text serves to restate my position within the themes of my research here at the Piet Zwart institute. These themes have been up to now: interfacings, tool access, craftsmanship, digital crafts, services - tooling & consequential products, need - services / specialists - responses, software issues, end user, modes of address, vendors, downstream, upstream. Establishing a position from which to be able to speak about these themes has been tricky. A lot of the debates included in these themes concern large demographics, groups of people that are refered to as 'the users', meaning pretty much everybody. I have felt somewhat uncomfortable about issuing comments on how I think these themes should engage with the general public because of this broad reach, and it's direct inclusion of general culture, general knowledge, and politics.
