I know this is the wrong way to be thinking about this, but, I think the topics in which I am interested are a bit clearer.

Overarching is alsways the urgency I feel for the adoption of the doings in open source, deliberately large, but more specifically; there are items.

1. The position part is complex, but I've started to untie it. Position is because of context, but this context has not been developped yet, really. Context is the historical political and economical schemes that get us to today. Heavily drawing on Stiegler here; is the idea that the capitalistic model up to now has been one that creates proletariat. This is not intented to be a comment on the issues of a layered class system, but more one of structrue, meaning that when activity moves towards a production model that complies with capitalism, it makes (for) a class of workers. When activity is split and devided in this way, most occurances place side by side isolated tasks or skills, with reception on one end and output on the other. Then onto the next isolated task.

This isolation has created attitudes in the teachings of knowledge sectors, in that scientists, biologists, engineers are no longer taught about  , they are not told about the history of their disciplin. This creates an alternative understanding of their education. They do not know about their disciplin anymore. But if they do not know about what their disciplin is, what do they learn? What do they know? These new students know how to do things, they have skills. They do not posess knowledge, they have skills.

SPEAK ABOUT THE POSITION AS NOT A STAND BACK? NOT AN ACTIVIST? BUT SOMEWHERE IN BETWEEN
