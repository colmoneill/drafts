Title: post tutorial with Femke notes
Date: 2017/02/13

We started by discussing the events of http://www.constantvzw.org/site/The-Clouds-are-Not-an-Option.html?id_evenement=2002 and the multiple perspectives the attendees there had. I showed Femke a small set of screenshots, and a set of [examples of problematic modes](http://tangible.tools/problematic-modes-examples.html) of address, collected across websites.

Then we discussed again the dialog and the problems that it might be to identify speakers in these new examples, especially when thinking back to the collections done around cookies, and the work done there already. Push the analysis of the politics (The art or science of government or governing, especially the governing of a political entity, such as a nation, and the administration and control of its internal and external affairs.) of the address, looking at the abstract dialog again. This is in a slight warning of the idea of the talkback plugin idea, because that idea plays into the hand of a built abstract fake dialog where speaker is invisible, but I try to answer back, nonetheless.

There is a sort of dialog but there is only the performance of a voice. The dialog is a script. It is not a conversation.

What if dialog is tweaked?
