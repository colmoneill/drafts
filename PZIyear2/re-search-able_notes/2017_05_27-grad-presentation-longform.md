Many supposedly technical words have become common place as a result of our adoption of devices that enable networking and interconnectivity. Some of these notions have taken on new meanings, possibly because of a lack of precision resulting from the mainly invisible nature of our connections. Programs, applications, technologies, sites and platforms, for example, are a set of conceptions I think can be easily interchanged without drastically altering the comprehention. I assume that the common understanding of these notions grows organically from example to example because for a regular user, as opposed to categorically, which might be the case for a computer scientist. There is not often a need or desire for specific distinction, but there may be an interest in function or offering.

The portion that displays and deals functions to the user is another notion who's meaning can be confusing due to it's wide use: interface. Interfaces are the key component in bringing computing access to the masses and yet, their modern trajectory is towards disappearance. (I'm talking about user interface here, not to be but easily confused with other types of computer interfaces such as hardware interfaces, application / binary interfaces or application / programming interface that all are shared boundaries between components but only user interfaces aim to speak to a non computer litterate person.) The development of user interface (UI) design has been ongoing since computers were ever thought to have a place in the laypersons home. However the position of UI design has been foregrounded in the last decade or so as new devices bring new interaction methods, pricipally, the touchscreen.

I have always been interested in user interface design as it appeared to me to be the portion of software that had to mediate the possible function of software and the varying digital litteracy of its users. The combination of visual an written language, thought out to enable computer power 'for all' seems like a valiant field. Having said all this, I began to observe a phenomenon, within user interfaces, that I could not pin as either functionnal or educational. The ways in which I am being addressed by software and website's UIs seems to be progressively informal.

#### observations & questions

What is the need for this informality? Why do these various websites and products want me to be intimate with them? Why do they want me to be so enthusiastic about their product? What role does this informality play for the designers? Is this an echo of the way the makers of x or y website speak among themselves?

Besides, who exactly is talking to me? Is it the designers? Is the the product manager? Is it customer support? My practice as a graphic designer keeps on reminding me that inter-face is about dialog. I know who is on my end, but who is on the other end?

A bit of a reality check, and technical knowledge about how web pages are templated and programatically rendered, and I see these informal addresses not as the pitch of a bad salesman, but as a larger symptom.

# We are in an age of mass data analytics. Big datasets only getting bigger as we integrate the functions of the internet into all of the dimentions of life. And as the reach of data analytics grow, so does the ability to treat each individual uniquely and warmly.
