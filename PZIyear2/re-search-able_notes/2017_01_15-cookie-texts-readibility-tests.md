<div class="colspan12-5">
In an attempt to better understand how the cookie policy texts are built, readibility tests seemed to be appropriate. A [recent post by Youtuber Nerdwriter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_aFo_BV-UzI) vocal language construction and readibility tests are brought to the forground to analyse political campainers speech. The subject matter of the video linked above (Donald Trump) being unfortunate, I'll leave it up to you to go and watch it if you like. The methods for text analysis however are very interesting. The video iteslf brings together data from these sources:

* [Barton Swaim, “How Donald Trump’s language works for him” (via The Washington Post) September 15, 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/15/how-trump-speak-has-pushed-the-donald-into-first-place/)
* [Emily Atkin, “What Language Experts Find So Strange About Donald Trump” (via ThinkProgress) 2015](http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2015/09/15/3701215/donald-trump-talks-funny-2/)
* [Matt Viser, “For presidential hopefuls, simpler language resonates” (via The Boston Globe) October 20, 2015](https://www.bostonglobe.com/news/politics/2015/10/20/donald-trump-and-ben-carson-speak-grade-school-level-that-today-voters-can-quickly-grasp/LUCBY6uwQAxiLvvXbVTSUN/story.html)
* [Jack Shafer, “Donald Trump Talks Like a Third-Grader” (via Politico) 2015](http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/08/donald-trump-talks-like-a-third-grader-121340)
