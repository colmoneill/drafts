# Project proposal v0.3
##### working proposal version for grad seminar on 24/11/2016

## What do you want to make?
I am collecting of some methods used to address a human without conversation.

When people can not be in the same space to discuss a matter, other methods have to be put in place to enable transfers. The reasons people can not come together could be spaciality or scheduling, but more lightly is the situation of a service use.

I'm interested in the relation between the mode of address and if / how it enables deeper or alternate understanding of what is being discussed. How do *Baby talking* or condescending tones effect the way we process information?

Do objects make us do things certain ways? Why? Are there ways in which the makers of these items would not like us to use their product?

We've got a duty, haven't we, to communicate, in a way that is understandable, accessible, not condescending, and not patronising, why we believe that this is the wrong path for the world.



## General introduction


## How do you plan to make it?


## What is your timetable?


## Why do you want to make it?
My interest in this comes from observing the attitudes built in to software I was tought to use while training as a graphic designer. These software tools touch both on a physical craft and a lot of programatic procedures. These procedures are used to extend the realm of the physical craft, but seem to make the original craft more opaque. It's an inbetween practice that appears in between the two that I am concerned about. It does not lead backwards to the craft, and it does not really lead forwards to the ways of d

## Who can help you and how?
An aspect that has emerged from the interface observation tests and exercices are some notions of narratives. To accomplish tasks in some of the software I've observed, sevoural steps are needed. First this, then that parameter, then this mode then the action, then maybe some tweaking after. You're following a timeline. I am surrounded by script writers and story tellers, I will be asking for help to look at this narrative in different manors. Maybe try bugging Frans-Willem Korsten if this track leads somewhere.
