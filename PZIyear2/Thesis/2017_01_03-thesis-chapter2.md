# Efficacy or efficiency

I wonder if there is not a widespread confusion between attitudes of *efficacy* and *efficiency* in software that has come to further confuse our understandings of digital practices as crafts of abstraction. Efficacy is the power or capacity to produce a desired effect; effectiveness. Efficiency is the ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. I don't think this distinction is often obvious, from the practitionners point of view at least. This has more to do with the vision that the tool maker projects of it's user, over the way the tool is employed, but this turn in address is one that needs to be taken apart.

My observations are that software tools makers find the need to justify how good their product is by explaining how much ease they can bring to a task. Easy, intuitive, understandable, logical are terms that are traded. It's important to remember that I'm arguing for the view that all software has a root in a type of manual work, and that that work got abstracted.

<blockquote>
*Technology is typically seen as a problem-solver, and well-designed technology **is supposed to follow an according aesthetic of efficiency**, ease and—ultimately—automation.*

What is the criterium for well-designed visual production software? Is that criterium in line with the established understanding of digital craft?
Is there a larger misunderstanding in software between efficiency and efficacy?
