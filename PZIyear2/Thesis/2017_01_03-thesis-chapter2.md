Title: Chapter 2 — Efficacy or efficiency

# Efficacy or efficiency

I feel like there may be widespread confusion between attitudes of *efficacy* and *efficiency* in software. It is not confused by the ones who use software, but indeed by the ones who make it. It has come to further confuse our understandings of digital practices as crafts of abstraction.

Efficacy is the power or capacity to produce a desired effect; effectiveness. Efficiency is the ability to avoid wasting materials, energy, efforts, money, and time in doing something or in producing a desired result. I don't think this distinction is often obvious, from the practitionners point of view at least. This has more to do with the vision that the tool maker projects of it's user, over the way the tool is employed. This turn in address is one that I think needs to be taken apart.

My observations are that software tools makers seem to find the need to justify how good their product is by justifying how much ease they can bring to a task. Easy, intuitive, understandable, logical, fast, ‘it just works’ are terms that are traded. It's important to remember that I'm arguing for the view that all software has a root in a type of manual work, and that that work got made abstract, somehow. So these trade words are primarely problematic to me because they presume a certain amount of preexisting knowledge of the task at hand, but presumes even more knowledge of the workflow that is expected in the abstract.

To this Morozov quote, I would simply preface with the word ‘software’. As mentionned in chapter 1, the build process of software seems indeed to follow an idea that it comes to solve a problem. The problem may be that text writing and text editing is repetitive, lenghty and wasteful on paper. Or it may be that manual arangement of image and text on the same surface requires lots of steps, specific machines, and trial and error to produce a piece of print. Either way, these manual procedures exist(ed) and somewhere along the line, somebody took account of it and started to build a solution to this problem. With this respondant method, the language that surrounds the interfaces for the solution will always be geared to answer this problem.

I'm throwing around notions of problems, solutions, procedures for their actual meaning and not their buisness related counterparts. I specify this because it is interesting to me to note the trend of *Software as a Service* that seems to be shaking up vendors. At the moment all I take from the SaaS movement is a turn in positioning, a turn in marketing that seems to confirm the complexities about offering a solution to a problem in software, and the methods for bringing this solution to the potential user.

A confusion between efficacy and efficiency is visible with some tooltips: I hover over the multiple toolbars in my vertor drawing application, for example, tooltips appear with only ever short sets of descriptors around an imperative form verb: ‘Create rectangles and squares (F4)’, ‘Create and edit text (F8)’, ‘Snap bounding box’. Instead of this language being a decription of what the tool can do, it speaks to me in terms of what the tool was meant to be used for. The simple turn of verb could suffice here, plain indicative present tense speaking of related objects would give descriptor sentences instead of orders: ‘Creates rectangles and squares (F4)’, ‘Creates and edits text (F8)’, ‘Snaps bounding box’.

Aside from this tonal obeservation, the incessant shortening of the legible language is beyond me. There is no reason for these tooltips not to be lengthened:

The only explanation I can come up with for this impertive speach is a desire to optimise space. Vector drawing programs, as other drawing programs, can and do get crouded with toolbars and windows. Is this the reason for the short text? To be out of my way so that I can get my job done? The further I go into this reasoning the less I believe in it. It would be very hard to tell if software makers consider the positions of speech that congugation implies, rather I think that the reason for short text might be that the software views itself only as a type of automation of a process helping to get a job done. As fast as possible.

This thread leads to the notions of productivity. The idea that methods can be employed to alter the speed of production. I think a lot of those trade words intutitive, easy, ‘just works’, are ways of talking productivity. The idea that a tool is trying to be efficient and get out of the way of production is interesting. I guess I can support it, if we were to think of a single utility hand tool, I can see how keeping it sharp and in good shape can aid my production, and the speed of accomplishing the task. But here is a gap. Software is very rarely only one tool. It's a collection of tools packaged together to practice multiple tasks of (possibly also mutiple) (a) field[s]. A single hand tool speaks to us with it's materiality, with handles and indictions of how it is meant to be used. This is not to say that it must not be learned and mastered, but it is much more outspoken than the collections software tools that are summed up in icons, toolbars and tiny tiny tooltips.

In and of itself, productivity is not a bad thing, I'm simply saying that if it is the only language it employs to speak to the user, then it won't ever portray itself as a space for experimentation and leasure, it positions itself in a chain of events and not as a stand alone interesting object.

Productivity, it's place in software, how it continues proletarisation

Up to now in this chapter I have only been considering complex software, software for creation, software of abstracting craft. I stand by the idea that even utilitarian software has roots in processes that can be considered craft, however, the scope of software utilities is clearly narrower. By utility I mean calendar apps, contact management apps, note pads (simple text editors), calculators. I bring these up because they also clearly have a desire to get out of our ways, to get thigs written, events noted, etc. Still they need to distinguish themselves from one another, and they also want to be intuitive and usable. A difference here is the presumed knowledge of the user for utilitarian software is often more on par with reality than in the cases of complex software. These more simple programs are and have been, in my opinion, an other intersting case to look at the projection that software makers have of their users.

Intuitive notions. Skeuomorphism

Efficiency vs efficacy is a difference of projection.

It's a film made by a someone who thinks you're a smart as he is.
