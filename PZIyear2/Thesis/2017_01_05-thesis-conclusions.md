# Conclusions

> Sennett further notes the inadequacies of written language to “depict physical action” (179).  Laboratories and workshops become the exemplar, places where “the spoken word seems more effective than written instructions” (179).    Sennett also illustrates this point by examining the how-to instructions of various chefs.  Ultimately, the instructions that show, rather than tell, provide the best experience and results for the novice cooks.  In these cases, however, showing was not done by physical presence per se, but through narratives and metaphors which “give each physical action [of the recipe] heavy symbolic weight” (193).

> Ultimately, I find The Craftsman to be a compelling argument for the dynamic matrix-like development of knowledge, character, and community.  All three of these, Sennett argues and I agree, are severely damaged when work is not understood as craft.
