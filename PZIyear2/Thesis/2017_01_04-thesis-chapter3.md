# The user, the learning curve

There is only one important constant in all of the development of computers: humans. The progress of computer sciences, but also of electronics and network infrastructures over the years are extremely important and key elements of this development, but it's the humans that make and the humas that recieve development that is the reason but also the source of all problems of the flourishing of computers as a cultural space.

In that light, a simple structure of the parties involved in the configuration of software, services and it's [...] implications on the world is necessary for analysis. These are: 1) developers and operators, i.e. the parties that develop software, architect services and operate the cloud infrastructure. Typically, service operators themselves use other services for development and may integrate services into their offering to their customers; (2) Curators, i.e. the end-user-facing entities that integrate software
structured as services into their own operations (they include so-called enterprise customers). Curators pick and choose which services to use with implications for their end-users. These curators can be IT departments, local web development teams or individual developers; (3) End-users, i.e. the individual
users, consumers, employees, workers, students, patients, audiences, who are affected by the structuring of software as services. (Gürses and van Hoboken, 2016)

Within this structure, I am the middle-man, the curator, and it is from this position that most of my thought development around the comunications issues of interface have spawned. My work as an independent graphic designer and website developper involves the choice and implementation of pre-existing tools and processes for clients to publish their content. I think it is important to restate my position here because all the subjects I've been looking at up to now in this dissertation are various constructs of related communication that give access to culture and functonality. Related communication happens all of the time in interfaces. In fact, it's pretty much the basis of it, but the horizontal nature of this comminication is for me the key to many issues I've looked at. In the last chapter I covered some examples of types of speach that exist in interfaces, short sentences that are statements of designed functions as facts, whithout any context to them. The also have signs of dialogic speach but with absolutely no way of identifying who the interlocuters are supposed to be. I'm finding that a lot of the communications in interface is left up to conventions, temselves not exactly well thought through methods. The tooltip here comes back to mind. It acknowledges the need for  more extensive information of a tool, but bypasses all of the communication needs very rapidly.

Like sciences and politics, built computation systems have spread and infiltrated all dimentions of society, they are research and constructs built by humans for humans, on various degrees of thiking evolution. Computers softwares solutions and technologies are our modern culture, they are place for

The user becomes an object, but at a peculiar position in the hierarchy of others. It is excluded from the internal transmission of information, and instead allocated representations of elements of this information as interface. This information is allocated on the basis of how closely it corresponds to the 'tasks' that users have come into composition with the software to perform. (Fuller, 2000)
