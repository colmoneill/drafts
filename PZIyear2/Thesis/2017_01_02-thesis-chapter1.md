# Defining ‘craft’

---

In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». As comforting as it is to be albe to put craftsmanship back to a basic human impulse, still in the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ». Without even needing to dig into the theses, Sennett shows that craftsmanship is somewhere within skills, technique, bodies and imagination.

> A major argument of Sennett’s is the role of social order in the development of craft.  Sennett states that an ancient ideal of craftsmanship is “joined skill in community” (51).  Medieval Workshops, in particular, provided a communal atmosphere and social structure that guided the development of skill through “authority in the flesh” as opposed to knowledge “set down on paper” (54).  There is an implicit authority in the workshop, a social order that values the “quality of skill” over “occupation of a place of honor” (61).  The workshop binds people together as if forms a community of masters and apprentices.  Quality and ethical codes of work are transmitted through such communities (and the guilds in which they participate) ensuring continuity while also allowing for creative developments through partnerships and communal participation.  The medieval workshop began its demise with the Renaissance separation of art and craft.  This separation emphasized the individual and her/his creation of “art” over communal development.  The workshop became an inferior social space reserved for a lower class of society. (Josh Sweeden, Ph.D. student in Practical Theology on ‘The Craftsman’, by Richard Sennett)

By the end of the 18th century / start of the 19th, we see the appearance of industrial capitalism. A capitalism of investments, that rests on a tight combination of techinque and science. This will enable very high levels of production, by, not only, but importantly, enhancing productivity, something we will come back to in chapter 2. Consequences of this is the destruction of a large portion (peasantry) of the population's physical health, not to mention it's ‘wealth’. The peasants then becomes proletarian, etc, etc. Our modern history has deconstructed craft. Away from the workshop, into the production chain.

> Next, Sennett explores the implications of machines (replicants and robots) for craftwork.  He ultimately shows how machines quickly were created for large-scale production, “gradually threatening the standing of the most skilled laborers and increased the number of semi- or unskilled workers.”  Sennett affirms machinery for the sake of eliminating “unskilled, noisome tasks,” but claims that it is problematic when it “replace[s] high-cost skilled labor” (106).  Instead of workshops, the new working community was steel mills and factories, and as such a new social structure was adopted, carrying different assumptions of appropriate work conditions as well as knowledge and authority.

20th century, something new happens, consumerist capitalism. The notion of consumerism, is likened to Fordism at first, not to be confused with productivist capitalism which supposes the proletarisation of the producers —the workers, that then become proletarian, who then would lose all of their profesionnal know how. In the consumerist capitalism model it's not only the workers that lose their know how, the effects and effects on mentality extend to the consumers, who don't lose knowledge, but certainly lose their savoir vivre. I disambiguate in historical context not to speak about software directly, but to be able to speak about the possibilities of craft within what software is.

It is simple in ways why practice with software is not directly viewed as a craft. First of all, by it's very nature, it is no longer a manual action. It starts and it ends on the same aparatus that sees all sorts of other information and media. It's the same aparatus that a lot of people use today, for very many other tasks. The only real basis for materiality within software is analogy: a major portion of application software interface relies on analogies such as files, folders, documents, desktops, copying, pasting etc. All through the spectrum of software, from the seemingly simple to the complex and specific, we're asked to draw upon understandings of the physical world: paint bruses, paint buckets, pencils to perform actions that are going to be like what using those would be in the real world, but not really. When Sennett says that *all skills, as abstract as they can be, begin as bodily practices,* it's hard to imagine one being able to develop skills in the way that we understand them thanks to Sennett in the virtual world of analogies.

It is also clear that Sennett's second thesis is hard to project in the world of software. One of the other specificities of software is that it is made by people attempting to solve to a problem, facilitate a specific task, the software maker defining the boundries, something that does not exactly stimulate imagination. This is not to say that technical understanding can not be acquired through the use of software, but again, the scope of that understanding is soully in the hands of the conciever of the intermediary. It's very simple to think of software only as a tool, and therefor, it has single tasks.

We are looking at a space for work that is extremely taylored. Programing is a sort of building by adding, in opposition to a manual craft which is more comparable to the selecting, sculpting, cutting down and combiations of pre-existing materials. When a program that enables a virtual practice is programmed, the construction model is the other way around to the manual craft. The developper must consider what the premices for the practice are. She/he must develop an understanding of what the craft is, and how it can be interpreted by a computer. Then the building begins to answer all the needs of the (interpreted) craft. I would add that this, even when done properly, is only half the battle, the other half being the building of the communication devices that will give access to all that has been engineered back to the intended end user.

I struggle to think of utilitarian(?) software (to no include games?) that does not have roots in some sort of craft. Even the most mundaine computer tasks like file sorting, can have ways of doing that are the result of *the desire to do a job well for its own sake*. If it didn't then we would have to demand alphabetical sorting, date sorting, logical directory structures, etc.

I feel a desire and a necessity to rethink what craft is today, when the computer is as primary tool. We have indeed lost physical tangebility, bodily actions and certain ways of imagination, but there is still enormous quatities of skill to be derived from the reimagined techniques.   
I'm not saying that anything that comes out of a text editor is the craft of a master typographer, not everybody that splits wood for fire is a carpenter, but

What is modern digital craft? Is it the same as old crafts with different tools and different outcomes? Is it still cultural production?

We begin with craft. Manual making, doing something with skill, often requiring dexterity or skilled artistry. Making items that are art and making items that are usable. We start with craft because I believe that there are still very many craftspeople active today, we just don't look at them the same way we look upon a chairmaker for example. In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». As comforting as it is to be albe to put craftsmanship back to a basic human impulse, still in the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ». Without even needing to dig into the theses, Sennett shows that craftsmanship is somewhere within skills, technique, the body and imagination.

On one hand, the artisan, the chairmaker, on the other industry. Industry is a different answer to the new economics of demand. So ways are developped to make more, and to make faster. It's not one single person's job to start, produce and finish a piece. The industrial chain exists from the process of taking craft apart. We now think in terms of workers and specialisations. Yet, craft still exists. Craft is still partly technique and imagination. In both of the procedures, single or industrial, we can admire technique. Be it fast, loud and money making, or be it slow, manual and unique, both the industry production and the craftsperson are objects for admiration, because they demonstrate skill, understanding and expertise of their methods, that we can see more that simply what has been made. We can see how, and sometimes we can understand why the objects have been made so.

Skills can be learned, they can be acquired. Not everybody is skillful in the same ways not everybody has the same techniques, but we can all admire skill. Properly brought together, skills can build technique, but for that to happen, body and imagination are needed. If and when all these elements come together, we tend to not think of them individually anymore, but more as entities. Mastery and expertise. Craftsmanship. I am detailing all of these steps because, crafts and craftsmaship has changed. They have evolved. Of course, it's highly probable that some chairmakers craft today exactly the same way that their peers would have several hundred years ago, but a lot of other fields have evolved. Industry happened, and sciences, applied sciences, electronics, mechanics and more sciences paved the way for electronics. And from there, we're a small step away from computing.

But we still need all of these crafts. Despite industry and science and electronics, crafts and skills are still things we need. Drawing, drafting, metal working, wood working, sculpting, machining, painting, these fields all still exist, despite progress. They exist as their own entities, and they exist within all of societies technical advancements. But they have not yet all met the challenge of being turned into the virtual version of themselves. Not all traditional skills have been decomposed in the manor of industry to be reassembled onto software.

When a manual skill gets considered for a software application, I suppose it is studied and looked at in terms of how it can be adapted, how it can be made to work along with and within existing programing languages. It is a sort of a funnel motion that happens, or maybe one more like a hourglass, where equivalents must
