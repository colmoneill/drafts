# Defining ‘craft’

### Traditional craft

*In order to establish a proper basis of vocabulary to talk about software, tools and their function, I must wind back to traditional crafts. From then, observations of their changings when looking at digital mediums will be easier to comment on. I stand in the middle of this question, because I think of my practices as a digital graphic designer as a craft, with it's tools and environment. More often than not, I'm faced with commissions that view digital design as a removed automatic practice that would have the same result whomever responds to the call.*

In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». As comforting as it is for me to think craftsmanship as a basic human impulse, still in the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ».

Sennett’s major argument is of the need of social order for the development of craft. He states that an ancient ideal of craftsmanship is “joined skill in community”. Medieval Workshops, in particular, provided a communal atmosphere and social structure that guided the development of skill through “authority in the flesh” as opposed to knowledge “set down on paper”. There is an implicit authority in the workshop, a social order that values the “quality of skill” over “occupation of a place of honor”. The workshop binds people together as it forms a community of masters and apprentices. Quality and ethical codes of work are transmitted through such communities (and the guilds in which they participate) ensuring continuity while also allowing for creative developments through partnerships and communal participation. The medieval workshop began its demise with the Renaissance separation of art and craft. This separation emphasised the individual and her/his creation of “art” over communal development. The workshop became an inferior social space reserved for a lower class of society.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup>

Taking a historic perspective: by the end of the 18th century / start of the 19th, we observe the appearance of industrial capitalism. A capitalism of investments, that rests on a tight combination of technique and science. This will enable very high levels of production, by, not only, but importantly, enhancing productivity,<sup id="a2">[2](#f2)</sup> something we will come back to in chapter 2. History shows how in this change, peasants become proletarian, and launch class separation into the working sphere. Malcolm McCullough poses a related question in his book Abstracting Craft — The Practised Digital Hand. He wonders from the current day perspective if there might not be a new class of computer workers appearing, that could itself turn into digital proletariat, if we do not adjust our ways and understandings to push for a guild of new digital artisans, rather than proletarians.

20th century something new happens; consumerist capitalism. The notion of consumerism, is likened to Fordism at first, not to be confused with productivity capitalism which supposes the proletarisation of the producers<!--—the workers, that then become proletarian, who then would lose all of their professional know how-->. In the consumerist capitalism model it's not only the workers that lose their know how, the effects and effects on mentality extend to the consumers, who don't lose knowledge, but certainly lose their savoir vivre. I disambiguate slightly in historical context not to speak about software directly, but to be able to speak about the possibilities of craft within what software is.

McCullough has a more involved perspective on the transformation of craft. He does not insist on social order, in fact, without contradicting Sennett, he speaks about the individual, the personal scale and skill. For and in craft, manual and conceptual skills are combined in a direct handling of real objects, depending on a certain coordination of hands, eyes and the mind.

Industrialism had started the split between hand and mind, and made for indirect actions. We had left handling and manipulations inside of other systems. Automation as a consequence of industrialism, but also as an idea itself, could be pointed to as a deadly factor of the disappearance of traditional artisanship because it works on the very basis of the redundancy of traditional tools. It displaced work out of the manual and into the creative symbols users: engineers, accountants and managers.

### Machines

To talk about machines more broadly: Sennett explores their implications (replicants and robots) for craftwork. He ultimately shows how machines quickly were created for large-scale production, “gradually threatening the standing of the most skilled laborers and increased the number of semi- or unskilled workers.” Sennett affirms machinery for the sake of eliminating “unskilled, noisome tasks,” but claims that it is problematic when it “replace[s] high-cost skilled labor”. Instead of workshops, the new working community was steel mills and factories, and as such a new social structure was adopted, carrying different assumptions of appropriate work conditions as well as knowledge and authority.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> The industrial age introduced an unprecedented abstraction of work, in which the motion of tools was powered by machines, and their manipulation became indirect. Soon, the means of production became too extensive to be handled by the individual craftsman.<sup id="a3">[3](#f3)</sup>

*From machines, I make the step towards software. My question is to understand how and why we can and should see computer work as a type of craft. It is clear that a lot of the basis for the notions of traditional craft are not directly transposable to digital practices, but we can distil core elements.* McCulloughs writings align elements that help to understand machine / computer practices as craft. (Note that the author is concentrated on Computer-Aided Design, but I will extend.) A first point of interest is the human hands, the manual action. In traditional craft, manual and conceptual skills, in a certain coordination of hands, eyes and mind, are brought together, combined to directly manipulate real objects. As we noted above, machines have come into this harmony and detached the coordinations. This is the first element that explains why it is complicated to view digital practice as a craft; we have lost a major portion of the manual handling. The practice starts and ends on the same virtualisation apparatus that sees all sorts of other information and media. It's the same apparatus that a lot of people use today, for very many other tasks.

The only real basis for materiality within software is analogy: a major portion of application software interface (which, even if not not all encapsulating, is the representation and view that I have of our digital tools) relies on analogies such as files, folders, documents, desktops, copying, pasting etc. All through the spectrum of software, from the seemingly simple to the complex and specific, we're asked to draw upon understandings of the physical world: paint brushes, wastebaskets, paint buckets, pencils to perform actions that are going to be like what using those items would be in the real world, but not really. McCullough is more generous that I am, in his view of materiality, and moves from hands, eyes and (hand-held) tools to representational and technological questions of symbols, interfaces and constructions. These are the elements that need to be valued, contextually and historically in order to regain appreciation for digital craft. We no longer operate literally manually, but we do depend on the idea of manual handling. Handling things, handling tools, handling constructs, handling objects.

### Objects
Objects. Be they manual or virtual, the core of the subject matter is the same for a crafts-person. Objects are the construction, the making, small or big, the building blocks for the practitioner. Just as they are in manual practices, they are just as present (if not more when thinking about encoding and markup procedures) in digital practices. “Whether direct or indirect, what matters is manipulation”.

So it was not initially so clear how Sennett's second thesis (« technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ») was to be projected in the world of software. But with the flexible notion of objects and constructs, we regain the value of the cognitive procedure, and imagination. I used to think of a specificity of software being that is is made by people attempting to bring a solution to a problem, facilitate a specific task. The software maker building towards that unique task, very specific task, rarely crossing other fields or lines of work, making for an ultra tailored solution that, theoretically I did not imagine to be an interesting stimulus for imagination. The notion of object though, and Sennett's second thesis indirectly infirms my though, places the emphasis on the software maker needing not only to communicate the solution that was imagined, but the methods and constructs that this solution depended on. If and when this cross communication happens, then I believe that software can be a great lead toward applicable imagination.

I see software as a (new) space for work that is extremely tailored. If I can imagine computer programming as a sort of building by adding, manual craft is in opposition, which I tend to think of more as a sculpting of pre-existing materials. When an program that enables a virtual practice is made, the construction model is the other way around to the manual craft. The developer must consider what the premises for the practice are. She/he must develop an understanding of what the craft is, and how it can be interpreted by a computer. Then, by building, begin to answer all the needs of the (interpreted) craft. I would add that this, even when done properly, is only half the battle, the other half being the building of the communication devices that will give access to all that has been engineered. Access to the end user. Half of the job (probably even more) is in the interface.

Interestingly, McCullough poses that it is the task of engineers to abolish the existing limitations of technology —in so far as they do not form necessary creative constraints— and to develop less obtrusive and increasingly transparent technical tools for the creative designer. This is something I wholeheartedly disagree with. His view goes along with an observatory, barely reactionary position of the users towards their tools. I do not believe that engineers are to be dismissed from developments, not at all, but it is not an engineers task to develop transparent tools, or less obtrusive methods, in fact, I will argue the opposite. If I, as a user, as a maker, am asking to review digital practices in the perspective of craft, then it is imperative that I adopt attitudes of a (traditional) crafts-person for my own self, and for my work. Having the perspective of an engineer and a user in the way that the former aims for transparency to better the latter's practice is tangent that makes way for more proletarisation, and continues history's effect on craft.

My position is that in order to help imagination to be stimulated by technical understanding, we need for engineers to be *more legible* in their proceedings. When I say that I must take on attitudes of a traditional crafts-person, I mean that I need to take interest in all the ebbs and flows of my practice, and each of the tools that it involves. I believe that it is my task to take interest in all of the objects and constructs that build my digital environment. I do not mean with this that I must become prolific in the handling of all of them, but having knowledge of their presence and workings can only better my understanding of my work environment, and my practice.

In fact, I find McCullough's saying ‘increasingly transparent’ to be fundamentally contradictory to his thesis, and extremely problematic. When I read increasingly transparent, I hear *less visible* — something which is clearly happening accross the board in software at the moment— but absolutely not something we need more of, or call for, especially in the desire for craft recognition. My belief is that we need less transparency between engineering layers. More ways of understanding the constructs of our programs, more ways of seeing how our files, designs, creations, makings are recorded and understood by our computers. I think that if there were to be a greater visibility of the granularity that is clearly present in programming, we would not only become better at what we are given access to, but we would gradually gain broader understanding of what we are working with, undoing the layers of abstractions of the virtual practice, and gain more ways of conveying our practice as objects, and not abstract intangible inexplicable things that we made.

### Abstracting craft, neo-craft

Aside from this disagreement, I do think that it is necessary to widen McCulloughs thoughts of Computer Aided Design to other spheres of software action. I struggle to think of utilitarian —as opposed to design oriented— software that does not have a type of root in some sort of craft. Even the most mundane computer tasks like file sorting, can have ways of doing that are the result of *the desire to do a job well for its own sake*. If it didn't then we would have to ask operating system makers for alphabetical sorting, date sorting, logical directory structures, etc. There is a need for us to rethink what craft is today, towards digital craft, where the computer is both primary tool and environment. We have indeed lost physical tangibility, bodily actions and certain ways of imagination, but there is still enormous quantities of skill to be derived from the —re-imagined— techniques.

McCullough calls this an ‘abstracting craft’ meaning a craft that has dependencies on it's own practice, but also on capacities of abstraction.

Rethinking and renaming craft is definitively a great start, but it might not be enough. I think that an additional dimension towards this reconsideration of craft could be helpful, and it is, in ways similar to Sennett's social order. The logics that have been built in to computing systems, can be thought of as kind of order that we actually all abide to as it is, we just don't really think about it so often; the orders don't make themselves apparent to the end user, but they can be simplified / understood as communications, requests and responses, managements and resource distributions.

For us to be able to perceive quality digital practice as a craft, we  also must be able to acknowledge —and celebrate— it's environment, comparable as it is to social order, how it came to be, and the immense amount of culture(s) and knowledge that makes it possible. We are part of this culture when we use computers, as it very early aimed to give access to it's power to all. It is a relatively young culture, but one that is given to us, made to work for us to and helps us to better ourselves, so in my opinion something that is worth celebrating. Then we may rebuild an appreciation for what is actually given to us through computing and software.

Logical as it might be that software made itself discreet and utilitarian, it is up to me as a user (but not only up to me, cfr chapter 3) to keep in mind what is going on ‘behind the screen’ or ‘under the hood’, during the actions on screen. Whether I know and understand it all or not, it's presence is not to be neglected. If we can keep in mind how amazing the ideas and sciences in play that make abstraction possible in order to permit, allow and better the ways of doing on screen, then we are one step closer to the build of widespread computation culture that is desperately needed for all.

One remaining aspect to address in this chapter is the perception of quality within craft. Quality is important here because it can be the key to appreciation. Quality is important because it is debatable. Perception of quality is important because digital culture needs discussion that spread to all that it touches, not only to the small portion of people that builds it's inputs. Quality is as complex in manual craft as it is in digital craft. It is not the object of this study to attempt an explanation of what quality is, instead, to acknowledge it's complexity. I think that the embrace of an adversarial attitude to all the understandings and views of quality would be healthy. The fact that contemporary philosophy is still in discourse about how to distinguish certain kinds of qualities from one another, points to large diversity, range, needs, desires, morals, and cultures of different people. This same multiplicity is involved in digital cultures, so I can not pronounce on what quality digital craft is for all of it's realms. However the presence of —albeit differently understood— good and bad quality objects is beneficial to the understanding of digital craft. The discussion of what makes a quality software product is, in itself, helpful to highlight the granularity and ‘social’ layers I call for above.

To refer back to the economic models noted over time and to etch out what my opinion of craft is within the realm of software; a newer perspective on the different historical frameworks could be to aim for the utopia of F/LOSS and call them ‘economies of contribution’: A contributive economy is an economy inside which those who contribute individuate themselves while contributing. This is the landscape, the Free/Libre Open Source Software landscape, where skills and communities come back together to rebuild know how, rebuild quality in social manors, for the better of themselves, and for the better of all involved. I believe this to be what we should be looking and demanding for, in and for digital crafts, after it's reestablishment.
