# Defining ‘craft’

We begin with craft. Manual making, doing something with skill, often requiring dexterity or skilled artistry. Making items that are art and making items that are usable. We start with craft because I believe that there are still very many craftspeople active today, we just don't look at them the same way we look upon a chairmaker for example. In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». As comforting as it is to be albe to put craftsmanship back to a basic human impulse, still in the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ». Without even needing to dig into the theses, Sennett shows that craftsmanship is somewhere within skills, technique, the body and imagination.

On one hand, the artisan, the chairmaker, on the other industry. Industry is a different answer to the new economics of demand. So ways are developped to make more, and to make faster. It's not one single person's job to start, produce and finish a piece. The industrial chain exists from the process of taking craft apart. We now think in terms of workers and specialisations. Yet, craft still exists. Craft is still partly technique and imagination. In both of the procedures, single or industrial, we can admire technique. Be it fast, loud and money making, or be it slow, manual and unique, both the industry production and the craftsperson are objects for admiration, because they demonstrate skill, understanding and expertise of their methods, that we can see more that simply what has been made. We can see how, and sometimes we can understand why the objects have been made so.

Skills can be learned, they can be acquired. Not everybody is skillful in the same ways not everybody has the same techniques, but we can all admire skill. Properly brought together, skills can build technique, but for that to happen, body and imagination are needed. If and when all these elements come together, we tend to not think of them individually anymore, but more as entities. Mastery and expertise. Craftsmanship. I am detailing all of these steps because, crafts and craftsmaship has changed. They have evolved. Of course, it's highly probable that some chairmakers craft today exactly the same way that their peers would have several hundred years ago, but a lot of other fields have evolved. Industry happened, and sciences, applied sciences, electronics, mechanics and more sciences paved the way for electronics. And from there, we're a small step away from computing.

But we still need all of these crafts. Despite industry and science and electronics, crafts and skills are still things we need. Drawing, drafting, metal working, wood working, sculpting, machining, painting, these fields all still exist, despite progress. They exist as their own entities, and they exist within all of societies technical advancements. But they have not yet all met the challenge of being turned into the virtual version of themselves. Not all traditional skills have been decomposed in the manor of industry to be reassembled onto software.

When a manual skill gets considered for a software application, I suppose it is studied and looked at in terms of how it can be adapted, how it can be made to work along with and within existing programing languages. It is a sort of a funnel motion that happens, or maybe one more like a hourglass, where equivalents must

In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». As comforting as it is to be albe to put craftsmanship back to a basic human impulse, still in the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ». Without even needing to dig into the theses, Sennett shows that craftsmanship is somewhere within skills, technique, bodies and imagination.

> A major argument of Sennett’s is the role of social order in the development of craft.  Sennett states that an ancient ideal of craftsmanship is “joined skill in community” (51).  Medieval Workshops, in particular, provided a communal atmosphere and social structure that guided the development of skill through “authority in the flesh” as opposed to knowledge “set down on paper” (54).  There is an implicit authority in the workshop, a social order that values the “quality of skill” over “occupation of a place of honor” (61).  The workshop binds people together as if forms a community of masters and apprentices.  Quality and ethical codes of work are transmitted through such communities (and the guilds in which they participate) ensuring continuity while also allowing for creative developments through partnerships and communal participation.  The medieval workshop began its demise with the Renaissance separation of art and craft.  This separation emphasized the individual and her/his creation of “art” over communal development.  The workshop became an inferior social space reserved for a lower class of society.

> Next, Sennett explores the implications of machines (replicants and robots) for craftwork.  He ultimately shows how machines quickly were created for large-scale production, “gradually threatening the standing of the most skilled laborers and increased the number of semi- or unskilled workers.”  Sennett affirms machinery for the sake of eliminating “unskilled, noisome tasks,” but claims that it is problematic when it “replace[s] high-cost skilled labor” (106).  Instead of workshops, the new working community was steel mills and factories, and as such a new social structure was adopted, carrying different assumptions of appropriate work conditions as well as knowledge and authority.

(Josh Sweeden, Ph.D. student in Practical Theology on ‘The Craftsman’, by Richard Sennett)

By the end of the 18th century / start of the 19th, we see the appearance of industrial capitalism. A capitalism of investments, that rests on a tight combination of techinque and science. This will enable very high levels of production, by, not only, but importantly, enhancing productivity. Consequences of this is the destruction of a large portion (peasantry) of the population's physical health, not to mention it's ‘wealth’. The peasants then becomes proletarian, etc, etc. The issues of productivity and efficiency are brought back in the second chapter, for now, I wish to focus on the dissapearence of skilled workers as a result of machinery.

To focus back on the object of this study, 




Sennett does find hope in new developments of high technology.  He cites the Linux Corporation which developed a sense of cooperation and collaboration among workers addressing problems.  Instead of a framework of competition which establishes “clear standards of competition and closure…needed to measure performance and to dole out rewards,” Linux succeeded through “technological craftsmanship, the intimate, fluid join between problem solving and problem finding” (33).  Linux revives a social space for craft similar to that of medieval workshops.  It is attractive for people who aspire to be good craftsmen, who are “depressed, ignored, or misunderstood by [other] social institutions” (145).
