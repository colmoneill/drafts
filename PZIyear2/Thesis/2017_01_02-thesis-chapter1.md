# Defining ‘craft’

We begin with craft. Manual making, doing something with skill, often requiring dexterity or skilled artistry. Making items that are art or making items that are usable. We start with craft because my belief is that there are still very many craftspeople active today, we just don't look at them the same way we look upon a chairmaker. In ‘The Craftsman’, Richard Sennett is fast to give a definition of craftsmanship: « an enduring, basic human impulse, the desire to do a job well for its own sake ». It's very comforting, is it not, to be albe to put craftsmanship back to a basic human impulse. Still within the prologue, he states his two main theses: firstly « all skills, even the most abstract, begin as bodily practices; » secondly « technical understanding develops through the powers of imagination ». Without even needing to the theses, Sennett shows that craftsmanship is somewhere between skills, technique, the body and imagination.

From the chairmaker to early industrial times, systems are now in place to make more, and to make faster. It's not one single person's job to start and finish a piece, there is a chain. We now think in terms of workers and specialisations. Yet, craft still exists. This chain came from craft apart. Also, some chose the former methods, some still believe in single person mastery. In both of the procedures, single or industrial, we can admire technique. Be it fast, loud and money making, or be it slow, manual and unique, both the industry production and the solo craftsperson are objects for admiration, because they demonstrate skill, understanding and expertise of their methods, that we can see more that simply what has been made. We can see how, and sometimes we can understand why the objects have been made so.

Skills can be learned, they can be acquired. Not everybody is skillful in the same ways not everybody has the same techniques, but we can all admire skill. Properly brought together, skills can build technique, but for that to happen, body and imagination are needed. If and when all these elements come together, we tend to not think of them individually anymore, but more as entities. Mastery and expertise. Craftsmanship. I am detailing all of these steps because, crafts and craftsmaship has changed. They have evolved. Of course, it's highly probable that some chairmakers craft today exactly the same way that their peers would have several hundred years ago, but a lot of other fields have evolved. Industry happened, and sciences, applied sciences, electronics, mechanics and more sciences paved the way for electronics. And from there, we're a small step away from computing.

But we still need all of these crafts. Despite industry and science and electronics, crafts and skills are still things we need. Drawing, drafting, metal working, wood working, sculpting, machining, painting, these fields all still exist, despite progress. They exist as their own entities, and they exist within all of societies technical advancements. But they have not yet all met the challenge of being turned into the virtual version of themselves. Not all traditional skills have been decomposed in the manor of industry to be reassembled onto software.

When a manual skill gets considered for a software application, I suppose it is studied and looked at in terms of how it can be adapted, how it can be made to work along with and within existing programing languages. It is a sort of a funnel motion that happens, or maybe one more like a hourglass, where equivalents must
