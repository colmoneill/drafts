<!--
* Central research question
* Why is it important for static visual production software to transfer knowledge?
  * What is visual production software
  * There is no visual production software that does not mimic a physical tangible action, something I believe to be a craft.
  * Physical tangible actions are what visual production software virtualises.
* run through all the subquestions from following chapters

This text aims to inform and anwser a research question about software, culture, and their current relation; **Why must static visual production software technologies transfer the knowledge and skills of the craft they virtualise?**

Some terms need specifications from this question, and this is where we will start:

* visual production software: tools that are enabled by PCs to create and produce static visuals. This subset includes both vector graphics creation and bitmap image production, covering the tools that a visual designer could use, big or small, on a computer.
* static: isolated here to not include animation or moving image intended visual tools
* technologies: best understood as detailed by Morozov:

> *Technology is typically seen as a problem-solver, and well-designed technology **is supposed to follow an according aesthetic of efficiency**, ease and—ultimately—automation.*

* craft they virtualise: the digital version that results from the craft

These definitions will be pushed further and contextualised in the first chapter. What is a digital craft? When is on computer practice a craft? Is all procudtion work on screen therfore the work of a craftsperson? Where do the actions come from? What or who determines the order of the proceedings? What are the models?

To attempt to understand some of the notions of software technologies for craft, beyond the early socio-historical contexts that explain why software came to be at all, we will look at the notion of efficiency and efficacy. What influences have they had on our understanding of software practices as crafts.

Later, the place of the user will be in question. Who is s/he, a user, a person, a worker, a link in a chain, an artist? How can s/he learn this environment? What is needed by a newcomer to understand the practice that is enabled by the software?

Finally, we will try and imagine what could happen to crafts that got and are getting virtualised. The workplace for practice is currently being shifted out of physical spaces, then onto personal computers, but now onto cloud computing services, what is the reasoning behind this third step? Is it necessary? Ultimately, a suggestion will be made, one that points towards tone of speech as a medium to be able to view modern practices as a transformation and not a loss.
