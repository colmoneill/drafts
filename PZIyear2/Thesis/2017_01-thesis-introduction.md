# Abstract:
The move away from manual crafts towards on-screen equivalents has been ongoing for the last 50 to 60 years. It is a regular phenomenon in this day and age. Computer and software technologies promise —potential— for accessiblity, flexibility, scale and speed of innumerable tasks. Many types of software are available for ranges of jobs, from every day actions to very complex and speficic profesionnal needs. This study first presents an understanding of what *craft* means today, now that different professions —say electrical circuit designers and photo editors— use very similar utilities. We look at how the practices and cultures that stem from manual crafts have been affected by their transformations to work within an operating system. It becomes clear that some labors have improved, while others have only —at best— been accelerated by the morphing. Therefor this study puts forward that a confusion between efficiency and efficacy when transforming a craft into a computer program can put severe weight on the origins and traditions of that field, and ultimately make the tool feel hermetic. (tentatively answering the question relative to why it is important that tools and practice transfer culture and knowledge) This observation drives the inquiry toward the user and the (re-)learning —curve. What is the users position in the new scheme of actions that is software? Is s/he supposed to know all of the reasonings and practices or is one to accept that *thit is the order of things* without any context? Either way, compliance is presumed. Lastly, we note that the workplace has also been shifted, first out of physical spaces, onto personal computers, and now again onto ‘the cloud’. What is the reasoning behind this third step? Is it necessary? Who is this helping, and what extra barriers does it place between practice and field knowledge? Finally, this study posits that a few reconsiderations, of the user and the way s/he is talked to by the software —and it's makers—, could be a very simple but important change towards a broader understanding of what is happening and why, with huge benefits for all involved.  

# Introduction:
This text aims to inform and anwser a research question about software, culture, and their current relation; **Why must static visual production software technologies transfer the knowledge and skills of the craft they virtualise?**

Some terms need specifications from this question, and this is where we will start:

* visual production software: tools that are enabled by PCs to create and produce static visuals. This subset includes both vector graphics creation and bitmap image production, covering the tools that a visual designer could use, big or small, on a computer.
* static: isolated here to not include animation or moving image intended visual tools
* technologies: best understood as detailed by Morozov:

> *Technology is typically seen as a problem-solver, and well-designed technology **is supposed to follow an according aesthetic of efficiency**, ease and—ultimately—automation.*
<br><small>To Save Everything, Click Here — Evgeny Morozov, ch 9</small>

* craft they virtualise: the digital version that results from the craft

These definitions will be pushed further and contextualised in the first chapter. What is a digital craft? When is on computer practice a craft? Is all procudtion work on screen therfore the work of a craftsperson? Where do the actions come from? What or who determines the order of the proceedings? What are the models?

To attempt to understand some of the notions of software technologies for craft, beyond the early socio-historical contexts that explain why software came to be at all, we will look at the notion of efficiency and efficacy. What influences have they had on our understanding of software practices as crafts.

Later, the place of the user will be in question. Who is s/he, a user, a person, a worker, a link in a chain, an artist? How can s/he learn this environment? What is needed by a newcomer to understand the practice that is enabled by the software?

Finally, we will try and imagine what could happen to crafts that got and are getting virtualised. The workplace for practice is currently being shifted out of physical spaces, then onto personal computers, but now onto cloud computing services, what is the reasoning behind this third step? Is it necessary? Ultimately, a suggestion will be made, one that points towards tone of speech as a medium to be able to view modern practices as a transformation and not a loss.
