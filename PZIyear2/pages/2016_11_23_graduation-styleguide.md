## When should it’s contain an apostrophe?
The only time it’s should have an apostrophe is when it replaces it is or it has. The possessive form of its should not contain an apostrophe, just like possessive pronouns such as hers don’t require apostrophes.

## Should punctuation be placed inside or outside of quotation marks?
In American English, periods and commas should always go inside quotation marks. In British English, unquoted periods and commas are placed outside quotation marks. For all other punctuation, American and British English have the same rule—if the punctuation isn’t directly part of the original quotation, then it should go outside the quotation marks.
