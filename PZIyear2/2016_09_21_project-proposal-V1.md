What are you thinking of making?
--------------------------------

How do you plan to make it?
---------------------------

Describe how you will go about conducting your research through reading,
writing and practice. In other words, through a combination of these
approaches, you will explore questions or interests you have laid out in
your general introduction. In this section you can help us understand
how your project will come together on a practical level and talk about
possible outcome(s). Of course, the outcome(s) may change as your
research evolves, but it's important to have some idea of how your
project might come together as a whole.

Why do you want to make it?

Who can help you and how?

Relation to previous practice
-----------------------------

How does your research connect to previous projects you have done? Here
you can use the descriptions you made in the first session or make new
descriptions

Relation to a larger context
----------------------------

Meaning practices or ideas that go beyond the scope of your personal
work. Write briefly about other projects or theoretical material which
share an affinity with your project. For example, if you are researching
urban interventions, you might want to research about Situationist
approaches to psychogeography, urban tactical media and activist
strategies of reclaiming the streets. Or, if you want to explore the way
data is tracked, you might touch upon the politics of data mining by
referencing concerns laid out by the Electronic Frontier or highlight
theoretical questions raised by Wendy Chun or others. (Keep in mind that
we are \*not\* expecting well formulated conclusions or persuasive
arguments in the proposal phase. At this juncture, it's simply about
showing an awareness of a broader context, which you will later build
upon as your research progresses.)

A list of references (Remember that dictionaries, encyclopedias and
wikipedia are not references to be listed. These are starting points
which should lead to more substantial texts and practices.) As with your
previous essays, the references need to be formatted according to the

elucidate your proposal. For example use images to reference your work
