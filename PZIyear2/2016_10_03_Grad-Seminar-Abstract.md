Technology is typically seen as a problem-solver, and well-designed technology is supposed to follow an according aesthetic of efficiency, ease and—ultimately—automation.

In this work, I will confront two timelines of actions, logging the happenings and events sequenced when using touchscreen apps. The sequences will be opposed visually and factually, meaning that one will deal with the actions and decisions that I as a user, make while using, the other will be the system response and extra actions happening behind the screen.

The project has a few specific aims; firstly to see if as many decision points on the user end reflect as many nodal points on the system side. This is why the confrontation of the timelines, possibly with an actual suface difider present, is important, I want to try and see if and what kind of additionnal unexpected actions happen in productivity focused systems.

This hopefully factual dual log will be a basis for the secondary aim, which will be to question the possibilties for *adverserial designs* (Carl DiSalvo, see quote)

<blockquote>
If we abandon the notion that any one design will completely or even adequately address our social concerns or resolve our social issues, then adverserial design can provide those spaced of confrontation—in the form of products, services, events and precesses— through which political concerns and issues can [be] expressed and engaged.
