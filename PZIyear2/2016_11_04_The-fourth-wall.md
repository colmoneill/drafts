# a cinema analogy

I've been thinking about this appelation of the 4th wall, the performance convention of the imagined separator, and the notable points where stories and actors break the narrative to acknowledge the audience.

Is this an appropriate borrowing for what I am trying to describe or may it be to heavily used already. Applied in the context of software interface an interesting item would be then the highlighting of the narratives inside software.

There are many ways in which this could be viewed, interface supposedly being a mediant between system and user, it gives way to conversations of sorts, not oral conversations, but ones that construct and come together to form bigger edifices. An other interesting perspective to look at interface as a narrative is that it is story telling. It includes the go along attitude that a story might have. *I don't really understand why I'm being show this now, how it relates to anything, but I can go along with this, probably the story goes on.*

Previously, I have spent time researching how scrolling is similar to a camera movement, and it also being a more or less used method of narrative, but it's interesting that the few identified narrative supporting methods of interface do not really work so well together. Scrolling constructs narrative in simple manors like message boards, letting you go backwards or forwards in histories. It can also be constructed when a website is designed for you to see portions of a told story in 'chapters', a practice synonimous with *long form webpages* or *single page sites*.

Clicking along different items in software menus also construct narratives, but they are more conversationnal.

Regardless of these methods, be they fully narrative without user input or conversational like menu items, submenus and their access, the user or the viewer is addressed in different ways. It is these modes of address that I am interested in, the times at which the actor acknowleges the audience, times at which the narrative is slightly broken and opens a path for something outside the usual methods of stories.
