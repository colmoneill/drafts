## Monday notes:

Because I had a tutorial & everything seems to be coming together; I asked Michael
about the scrollometer prototype (a test subject to learn JS) which is now becoming a bit bigger.

scrollometer is here at the moment https://github.com/colmoneill/prototypes/tree/master/scrollometer,
need to commit some last things in a second.

####So here is a loose list of items said today:
* relative units
* pixel density
* finger movement size
* screen size unit
* px to cm
* origin of inches = 3 acorns of something
* body sized measures
* what your browser says, what you say, what is real (measurments)

#### Then the connection point:
For this prototype 'to make sence' I thought of trying to integrate it as a broser plug-in. Then it could maybe work across tabs, and really be a distance tracker. So [greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) was suggested! It's the JS counterpart (is it even run by the same people?) to the Stylish plugin for custom styles in browser.

I really like this un-stacking attitude CSS, JS & HTML are rendered on my side, in my client, and they have an order, but these plug-ins let you wedge in the sequence and stop one thing of happening, for better or for worse, it just tops all intended interpretation and listens to user input.

**It creates friction between the boxes**
