## Monday notes:

Because I had a tutorial & everything seems to be coming together; I asked Michael
about the scrollometer prototype (a test subject to learn JS) which is now becoming a bit bigger.

scrollometer is here at the moment https://github.com/colmoneill/prototypes/tree/master/scrollometer,
need to commit some last things in a second.

####So here is a loose list of items said today:
* relative units
* pixel density
* finger movement size
* screen size unit
* px to cm
* origin of inches = 3 acorns of something
* body sized measures
* what your browser says, what you say, what is real (measurments)
