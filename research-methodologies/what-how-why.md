#### How
With a complex relation between the directors and the people responsible for communication outwards about the gallery. Practically; with a bunch of web based technologies, databases and some connections made between different tools. Personally: with a lot of patience and care and deep, calming, therapeutic breaths.

#### Why
Because I have acquired some knowledge on the techniques that could enable such a project. Also because I enjoy web development, and the gallery's point of view on art. Interchange these 50 times: to make a living, and to pay rent / out of interest for the bigger project.

## HEAR - Haute Ecole des Arts du Rhin — HTML 2 print

This was a workshop I was asked to organise for the students of an art school in Strasbourg in France in March 2015. I developped a set of work sessions around markup languages for the web and the way of styling the content with aims of printing it from the browser.

#### How
With help from other researchers on this topic I devised ways of relating the markup language structures to text hierarchy. Rather than sitting down and plainly learning HTML, we went through versions of this language that let us use extra layers of abstraction. This abstraction helped us to remain focused on structure rather than semantics.

#### Why
Because this is an interesting topic for graphic designers who regularly need to deal with hierarchy in content. Also because the school's project call was interesting. It displayed a healthy dose of openness. Also because I enjoy the idea of challenging schooling models. Teacher to students versus peers to peers.
