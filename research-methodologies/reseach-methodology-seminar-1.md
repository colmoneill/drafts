Art in the Age of... Asymmetrical Warfare

a) describe a work in the show

##### *Autonomy cube*, 2014 / Trevor Paglen with Jacob Appelbaum

The piece stands on the exhibition floor, placed on top of a white stand. It contains a cluster of circuit boards, neatly organised together, cables linking them together, and one cable bundle piercing through the base of the cube, through to the stand. The dimensions of the cube exactly match the ones of the stand, so while it has a presence in space, it remains relatively discrete.

The total amounts to a height of 116cm, and is described by the gallery as *mixed media*. That is no understatement.

The work is described as a sculpture, and also comes with the artist given tagline <sup>[1]</sup> meant to be "seen" and "used".

Photographer, sculptor and journalistic investigator. Paglen *looks for art to develop ways of seeing, things that help us see historical events of today*<sup>[2]</sup>. He takes concern in the topic of privacy, in some cases very directly, but for the majority of his pictural work, he observes the physical (not software or hardware or network) techniques that governmental bodies employ to hide their activities.

In his photographs, we see phenomenons such as radial heat, and air pollution, as well as atmospheric pressure on display, which are not new to the field of photography and lens based observation, but when they are shown in the contexts and themes of this artist's work, they take on a function of disguise, deliberately employed by the hidden.

notes on the works context within the exhibition (and or) the broader cultural context of the piece

Within all of the topics eluded to in [...] Asymmetrical warfare, this portion of the exhibition deals with data processing. It is the closest we get to the software mechanics of this asymmetricality.

The scenographic relation with the **James Bridle** piece *The Fraunhofer Lines* is thematic, but passive because of the visualization ambition of the prints, whereas the *autonomy cube* attempts to be active.

<sup>*Maybe a section on why I chose this piece rather than the next? That it is a relation between things that interest me, things I find relevant, if / or how the art piece affected me or resonated with me, and what I actually plan on doing with this afterwards?*

This relates to my work or at least what seems to be fueling my research at the moment is the aspect of transparency. There is a not so subtle display here of revelation through the plexiglas while proportionnaly this thick plexiglas would be near indestructible.

It has an almost activist standpoint of demonstration and protection, a revelation of procedure and a setup of protection.

Beyond picking apart the visual apparatus in use for this sculpture, the aspect of "use" has not yet been addressed.
