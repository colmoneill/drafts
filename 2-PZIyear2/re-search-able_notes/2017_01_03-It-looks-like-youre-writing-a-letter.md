## Notes on M. Fuller; MS Word: It looks like you're writing a letter.

Gorz's defininition of autonomous labor: "We can call someone autonomous when s/he conceives and carries out a personal project whose goals s/he has invented and whose criteria for success are not socially predetermined."

> In comparison to the disappearable production lined individual here the worker is expected to encompass and internalise knowledge of the entire application wich replaces it and to be able to roam about, freely choosing their tools and their job. The quandary forthe self which Foucault presents:
> > How does one govern oneself by performing actions in which one is onself the object of those actions, the domain in which they are applied, the instrument to which they have recourse and the subject which acts is at once doubled for the self whose actions, object, domain and instrument are amalgamated with a material-semiotic sensorium —a program— whose entanglements and interrelations are so multifarious.

Foucault's view is noted as far worse: The anxiety of loosing a hold on professional integrity and sinking into popular culture mist be restraned for hte sake of thinking out a phenomenon we are now living through and in which we are participating.
