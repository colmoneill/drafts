Title: visualising website cookie policy information

## cookie policy information breakdown
<div class="colspan12-5">
The last post that dealt with cookies looked at the different phrasing methods that were employed by different websites to comply with the requirements of the policy. On this page, I'm attempting different deconstructions of the language, visually. By tagging and splitting the text on the occurences that mention the two parties concerned by the policy i.e. the website, and it's visitor; me, I try to see what the text would be like if it was actually a dialog. A text layed out where I as the visitor can see where I'm been spoken to, or about, and when the website mentions itself.

I've picked two examples out of the selection of cookie policy texts, one from the BBC, the other from Facebook. It's my opinion that one of these sites does a good job of addressing the user directly legibly, and gives access to options. The other is more subversive in it's compliance.
