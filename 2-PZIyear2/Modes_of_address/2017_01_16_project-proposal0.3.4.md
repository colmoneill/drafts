# Project proposal v0.3.4
## Modes of address

My research project is about modes of address. The way I speak, the way you speak out, the way we are spoken to, and the way speech is when intermediaries are present. Address, as a word, includes the notions of direction, guiding and giving destination.

I want to make a case for dialog type of speech in interfaces that require actions. I am not asking for all language to be made simpler, across all boards, there is of course a need for litterature, academia and longer form writings. I'm pointing at the specific cases where actions are asked, and practical knowledge is involved. This is the language I want to observe and comment on.
