Called this doc outro for intro film, in a fashion that, again, only speaks to me.

In my work on interface, I will be making a point that the evil that is sometimes hidden behind the non actions and the non education or dis-education though interface would not happen if there were a visual connection.

I think a lot of questionable issues have been brought up

I think there are a lot of questionable motivations behind actions done within interface today. I think that there are a lot of things that are done by social constructs, such as companies, that would not have taken place without these layers of abstraction.

A worker reports to a superior, lightly part of a team, itself a cog in a departments, responsible for one aspect of an organisations work. Each of these echelons are types of layers. Places for interaction and require interfacing. This is the amont point of view. From the aval, there are fewer individuals. These people usually have the most questionable morals. They sit on top of the pile, they hold the reins, and they care about profit, possibly exclusively profit.

This is one chapter of layers. There are quite a few others that come with the practicalities of distribution, retail, sales, marketing, and all of the other words I love. These chapters have a sequence, order of which distance us from all of the people that added elements to the product I use (I become).

I have faith in the individual, I truly believe that no one would act in this way deliberately, one on one. The only reason this passes, is because of all the chapters, all of the wrappers.

These brands don't sell us solutions they sell us ideologies, one of usability, and connectivity, and distribution, and beauty, and belonging. They offer constructs in answer to problems. They offer an attitude, not a resolve.

Here is the thing though. I know there is an other side. I understand now that computers are a reflection, one dimension, if only a facet, of human culture. 

I am a jack of all trades, and a master of none.
