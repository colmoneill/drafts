<p>Slowly moving towards a broader consideration of interface and black boxing. Was the clarity I was calling for just a result of logical development following a method of boxing tools &amp; utilities up? Are these boxes in a chain sequence or is it more organic? Where do I, the user, stand in this sequence?</p>
<p>The 'necessity' for such a system is clear, I'm glad one does not have to run each intricate item and dependency when executing a task. This model is not flawed or even really broken in any way. I'm looking at a logical consequence of this modeling: it's <em>opaqueness</em>. (Looping back to this seems terribly logical. It is suddenly quite a simple point to be looking at my research from, but anyway.)</p>
<p>I'm putting aside the moralistic and fearful opinions I have voiced between the start of the year and now, in order to concentrate on projects that might generate discussion / opinions for the audience it self.</p>
<p>Anyway, in attempting to answer the question around the structure or sequence of the black boxes scheme, I collected a few examples of attempts of visualisations:</p>

<h4 id="temporary-conclusion">Temporary conclusion:</h4>
<p>I understand why these technologies are boxed up, and why these boxes must exist. I am fine with them, but understanding their sequence, and where I stand in their chain could be valuable.</p>
<p>So I started to look at the spaces between the boxes. Leverage points. Friction points, where it might be possible to insert objects (prototypes) in order to reveal the structure.</p>

<li><p>tips by tools: a bit old now, but still something I want to finish off. I attempted some javascript prototypes but not very promising with my skills at the moment. So I designed what I imagined the item to be, and I also have a CSS only proof of concept. Modes of address in interface.</p></li>
