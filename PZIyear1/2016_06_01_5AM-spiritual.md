There is a track called like this, 5am spiritual, I think it's from interpol, or maybe Real Estate, I can't find it by searching for it, so I'll just have to look it up online when I get a connection.

Forget it, I found it, it's actually Smith Westerns, and it's called 3am spiritual, which is fine, but it's actually 5 am right now, so.

I did just listen to an entire Simon and Garfunkel record, and it put me in a great mood. I'm in the night bus from Brussels to Rotterdam, which I just found out includes a stop over in Breda, making it the least efficient trip over imaginable.

We had the OSP AGM last night, I think I'm still quite amped up from it. I also slept a few hours before getting this bus, a combination I have known to confuse my body to no end. Anyway, something like 40 minutes are left on this bus for me, so I thought it might be time for one a ramble.

There is lots to do still for OSP. LOTS to do. Practically and conceptually. And also in terms of the group realising it is still a group, made of individuals, working together, finding the right balance between self expression and internalising opinions in favor of efficiency. But not everybody is seeing that right now. Hard to bring it up without shutting someone down.

Had a few randomly laced together thoughts before pulling the computer out; I'll try and re-itterate them somehow quick:

I now realise how little I miss design practice, but that I must maintain it as in the image making skill that I had once honed but am slowly loosing touch with. This is not similar to code languages practice. I don't seem to forget them. I still get enjoyment from them too, and great power comes along with that ability, I can't forget to maintain the similar power that comes with being able to finish an image, finish a drawing, adjust it for a situation. Mapping is the only real graphic design practice I have had recently. This I do enjoy. Need to continue exploring GraphViz also.

Leading away from that was the idea of a jack of all trades and a master of none. Sort of brought up by my Dad asking me in quite a light, non worring way: so what *are* you going to do after this? Top 5 dream jobs:

* Full time OSP researcher; something about making a project work almost from the ground up, and long term comittment.
* Project manager at Mozilla
* Code & design educator, maybe in an art school, not in a tech school
* public advocate, activist for the FSF, or similarly tangential organisation.
* 5 is because of Hornby, I'm actually surprised I could come up with more than 2.

A thought about investment in education programs related to their geographic implantation. A challenge would be to find a way to develop a program that would not depend on a national or regional government. European funding. Maybe bigger if such a thing existed. It's either that or being stuck in one very specific location. But that is Clare's problem maybe.

Meanwhile, I have a tutorial coming up with Femke, and the end of year is creeping up fast too. Am I actually ok with the amount of work I did this year? I think a lesson from the last assessment was that I can clearly be all inclusive in school about what my practice is.

I still think working out the mode of address thing is interesting. Or at least stating it. Making the connection to censorship is still not clear, but this can be ongoing.
* speak about podcasts, inner ear
* speak about vlogs, inner something else experiences
* speak about attention spans

Also the NFC OV chipkaart thing coming back is valuable. The shift for me happened when I understood this sell by date issue. This hack won't work for long. It's a short window. But that might be the dimension we need to make this into something we can talk about publicly. It's illegal, but it's funny if it becomes temporal. Make into a machine? Fully script the entire thing? Make it look like one of the boxes in the super markets?

But mainly I have to continue making prototypes. I haven't even finished the scroll meter at this point. But still, brainstorm brought me back to the idea that interfaces are full of illusions. Illusions that we accept, but that distance us, conceptually, from what happens underneath. I should find more of these wedge points;

* a touch counter (touch events) as an intimacy gage?
* the click execution? The click action
* look at more event listeners?
* more sound transcriptions? Ref lissajous work during chain reaction workshop.

Exclusive practices, inclusive practices. Tangible tools. I want a computer environment that sometimes reveals things to me, not one that hides it all away from me. Tangible tools. A collection of inclusive tools, that speak to you as a person, not as an user.
