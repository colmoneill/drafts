##*Software as a Critique*

*Sunday 14 February 14:00-18:00* *@ LAG*

1e Schinkelstraat 14-16, 1075 TX Amsterdam

////////////////////////////////

```
*A discussion introduced by software cases like Pattern for Python,
Faircoin Wallet, MakeHuman, The Unicode Standards.*

With: Kym Ward, Aymeric Mansoux, Jara Rocha, Roel Roscam Abbing, Femke
Snelting, Dick Reckard.

Due to the importance and ubiquity of software in our lives, it is urgent to recognise and deal with the political and social elements that are translated into the technical domain and vice versa. Looking from the technical side, code often replicates existing social constructions, reinforcing existing hegemonies or mirroring cultural patterns of inclusion and exclusion. Conversely, technological elements have their own political
agency, beyond conventional parliamentary politics, aiming for example
towards efficiency, quantification, transparency.

In this afternoon meeting, we will start by looking at the interactions
between technical and non-technical aspects of specific pieces of software
that raise political or ethical issues. We’ll be looking at questions like:
What happens when you translate a body into a 3D mesh? What variety of
people are involved in crypto-currencies, and how do their different
political views transfer into decentralised banking systems? Who decides
how we get to choose our gender from drop-down menus, and who benefits from
a multiplicity of options? What is at stake in the challenge of a machine
that writes poetry?

After considering how such questions translate in potential and existing
software practices, we’d like to discuss whether they could inform a kind
of critique that is not confined to the spaces of artistic or academic
discourse. Can these approaches and methodologies create a space of
critique inside software-centered communities that is not segregated from
its productive practices?

### Meshenger

```
Meshenger is a Forban-inspired messaging software used for a speculative broadcast communication project. The starting point is an electronic messaging system running on a wireless mesh network. The messages propagate through the network when devices that come in contact with each other synchronize their content. It is non-hierarchical, every node receives, relays and broadcasts messages.

Using Meshenger, devices detect each other by continously broadcasting an identifier packet while listening to those of other nodes. As soon as two (or more) nodes detect each other they will try to synchronize the messages on each node.

The users of the network can interface with the nodes to send or receive messages by using the webbrowser of their smartphone or computer. The messages can be received and sent at any time, but they are only synchronized in the network when other nodes are encountered.

Meshenger is supposed to run on an Open-WRT router that has been configured to work in mesh networks (for a configuration how-to see below).

A point made about a choice made towards inefficiency, as a reslut of chosing not.

**Segway to Airchat project**
'Free communications For Everyone.'
https://github.com/lulzlabs/AirChat

It's a code repository, bit it doesn't really work as is, it's more like a punk place for speach.
Norms are addressed, with a focus on finding counterparts.

```
We saw people working on different mesh related projects and we thought 'One solution shouldn't discard another one but it should try to complement it, to add interoperability and to allow heterogeneous systems'. As different serious projects are looking for solutions based on 802.11 standards we said, 'WTF lets try to reinvent the wheel for exploration and fun'.
```

We take a look at the license of Airchat to try and make sense. It's a dérivé of the `Do Whatever You Want license`

### Make Human
Femke Sneltings & Jara Rocha

Described as middleware, runs within the Blender env. Create human(oid) figures that later can be animated.

Waht does it mean to call it middleware. What is software as a critique, what is critique, what is softwre. Is it subjective? Is it hermetic?

Make human is middleware: 'it is a device to produce an ocjet that won't be the final outcome, but is somehow like a midway for someone else to use.'

Framed under 'parametric design software'. Decision making based on a set of parameters. The software producers design the parameters.

The translation of gender gradient is with a slider. From 0 to 100. It's limited to 100 options of left or right, male or female. A limited set of parameters for representation.

Conditions == circumstance of production.

The label of the interface really translate as assetions, not as open questions.

Then the translations of the labels, a typical case of a light contribution to free software.

'part of this project may contain nudity'!

The language files are sort of transitionnal objects: they are sort of extracted from the core of the software, they are set aside to be made easy to be translated by non devs. Interesting split of labor.

So running re-running the program without any labels, creates a situation of disorientation.

### Faircoin: the use case of FairCoop(?)

A crititque of Bitcoin, which requires you to have more computing power to be able to participate today. Faircoin looked at the ecological aspect of this requirement as well as the ethical balance of needing more to access more.

Proof of stake instead of proof of work.

The formulation of the title Software as a critique as a dual memory of the context and the acto making critique.
