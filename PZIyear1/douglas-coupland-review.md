## The internet isn't just a thing

Douglas Coupland may have had some sociological importance back in the day, but this art show, I can not stand by.

Everything contains everything.

Pop culture and internet culture can not be thought of as mirrors.

The internet is a culture, yes, but it is not a different kind of culture.

The internet is one of the latest reflection of our culture. There is nothing that new or strange there.

Google Cultural Institute Paris ?! C'mon!

from the press release:
>Throughout the exhibition Coupland shares his thoughts on globalization, terror, the Internet, pop-culture, social media and the resulting accelerated image economy. Taking its title from the phenomenon in which digital data spontaneously and quickly decomposes, Bit Rot creates an associative and visually playful constellation in which memory, loss, fame, violence, destruction, and creation are subjects for contemplation.

This means shit. The exhibition contains only a douzen pieces; it hardly addresses any of these issues seriously. And after all that announce, «the resulting accelerated image economy» ? None of the pieces land near to dealing with the resulting accelerated image economy. Who the fuck is anybody to call this an image economy? An art gallery employee, or Coupland himself? Both of which are, if anything the definitions of this economy, which up to now has only ever been looked at as an uphill battle.

Maybe it's ok to think of it as an economy if you work for google. Yes then, in that case, maybe you're seeing the internet as an economy.

A workshop called cocktails & helvetica
seemingly around the worst internet based puns imaginable, which are empty of any sort of lateral meaning, basted on booring colors, with bad centered type.

The attitude of using these throughout the gallery and at the opening asks you to play along with these ideas, asking you to say yes to these items said by other, taken out of context by Coupland.
